Space Nerds In Space is an open source multiplayer networked spaceship bridge
simulator game inspired by another game called "Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator"
It is still a work in progress, but it is substantially far along, and reasonably
free of bugs as far as I know (the game should not crash, in other words.)

Here is some video from February 2019, at HackRVA in Richmond, Virginia:

Features:

* Terminals for Navigation, Weapons, Engineering, Damage Control,
  Comms, Science, and Game Master.
* Multi-crew (multiple bridges) supported
* Terminals may join/leave/re-join games at any time.
* Asteroid mining
* Bounty hunting
* Travel between instances of the game via warp gates in an arbitrarily
  large universe of solar systems.
* Dock at starbases to repair your ship, buy/sell various commodities,
  sell mined ore, obtain warp gate tickets, etc.
* And of course, fly around and shoot stuff.
* Lua scripting API for mission scenarios.

Note: This game is meant to be played on a LAN with all players in the same room.
Bandwidth requirements are on the order of 100k/s per client.
