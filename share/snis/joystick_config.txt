# Joystick config file for Space Nerds In Space
# The code that reads this file is in joystick_config.c
#
# If you add any new joystick configs to this file, please
# consider forwarding the new config to stephenmcameron@gmail.com
#
# the "device:" lines are followed by a regular expression to match the
# name of the joystick device as it appears in /dev/input/by-id.
# (See the output of ls -l /dev/input/by-id).
# Note, I am using the old style devices that link to /dev/js*, not
# the new "evdev" devices. You can tell the old from the new as the
# new device names end in "-event-joystick", while the old names just
# end in "-joystick" (no "-event-").
#
# Following each "device:..." line, are the mappings from (mode, (button/axis)
# tuples to game functions for that device.
#
# The modes are as follows:
# (See DISPLAYMODE_* #defines in snis_packet.h)
#
# mode 0 - main screen
# mode 1 - navigation
# mode 2 - weapons
# mode 3 - engineering
# mode 4 - science
# mode 5 - comms
# mode 6 - demon screen
# mode 7 - damage control
#
# The game functions are as follows:
#
# roll, pitch, yaw, phaser, torpedo, weapons-yaw, weapons-pitch
# damcon-roll, damcon-pitch, damcon-gripper, throttle
#
# Here are examples of mapping a mode + button or mode + axis to a function:
#
#  mode 0 button 1 phaser		# map mode 0 button 1 to phaser function
#  mode 1 axis 2 yaw			# map mode 1 axis 2 to yaw function
#  mode 1 invert axis 3 roll 		# map mode 1 axis 3 to roll function and invert the axis
