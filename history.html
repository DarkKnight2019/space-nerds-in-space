<p>Hi guys... I've got a new project rolling these days...

<p>https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space

<p>Still in the pretty early days, not even "playable" yet, really, though I expect to approach "playable" tomorrow or in the next few days (though no where near polished enough to be considered done.)

<p>So this game (when it becomes a game) is very much inspired by Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator
See: http://www.artemis.eochu.com/ The idea is you have a game which is played much as the actors in the Star Trek TV series played their roles on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. There are a number of "stations": Navigation, Weapons, Science, Communications, etc. and each player assumes that role. Each station has it's own laptop or other computer which communicates via network to a central server which simulates the game universe. So it's kind of a cooperative multiplayer network game... No reason not to have multiple teams in multiple starships inhabiting the same server/universe either cooperating or doing battle.

<p>Mine is different than Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator in that it is:

<ul>
<li>GPL'ed.
<li>Linux/gtk
<li>Probably uglier (lol).
<li>Probably more scalable (yay vector graphics.)
<li>Not even close to finished.
</ul>

<p>Here's a video from a couple days ago... (much progress since then.)
<p>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF19sPZGvmo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF19sPZGvmo</a> (yeah... it's not much to look at yet.)

<p>Hoping to be able to "drive" the ship around the "universe" and "shoot stuff" sometime tomorrow... we'll see.

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I'm not sure what you're asking...

<p>It's going to be real time, but the action is probably somewhat slow, not frenzied. In some ways it's a simulation, but, also an action game?

<p>In any case, I've gotten pretty far in the last day.

<p>You can now drive and shoot, which as everyone knows, are the two most important activities of a starship captain.

<p>Individual players can join the game at any time, and specify which starship to join, and multiple starships per game are possible. (this is all working now.)

<p>That being said, you can pretty much *only* drive and shoot -- and the torpedoes don't ever hit anything, or die -- the torpedoes are immortal, just like everything else in the game so far (deleting objects from all the clients is not straightforward, but should be do-able, just haven't done it...)

<b>Skorpio 04 Nov 2012, 20:51</b>
<p>With simulation I meant a more complex game in comparison to a simplistic action game, but of course a simulation can be simple as well and contain lots of action (like the farming simulator :D ).

<p>Got a lot done over the last week, as I was on vacation for Thanksgiving. Too lazy to do a video today, so just some screen shots:
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZGfxh.png">
<p>Above is all the client modes (screens) Weapons, Navigation, Science, Comms,
Engineering, and Debug. They are small because, like Word War vi, the graphics
scale to match the window size, and I have shrunk them all down to fit on the
screen. They are all separate processes communicating via network with a server
process. The large screen partially shown on the right is the "main" screen.
Any client process can "project" his screen onto the "main" screen by pressing
"ctrl-O" -- O for "on screen!", as Capt. Picard so frequently says.  
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0n0yU.png">
<p>Above is the navigation screen. Left/right arrow keys rotate the ship,
up/down arrow keys move the ship fore and aft. The Warp drive slider and
"engage" button "warp" the ship instantly through space (the warp drive needs
some work to make it a little more intuitave and, uh, dramatic as well.)
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GZNuo.png">
<p>Above is the Weapons screen. Torpedoes may be loaded into the torpedo tubes
(2) and fired at passing ships. This needs work (sound effects) and also, right
now, a single hit invariable annihilates whatever it hits, so that needs
fixing. Phasers don't work yet.
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NMUx1.png">
<p>Above is the "science" screen (scanning). You have a scanning beam that you
can swing around using left/right arrow keys. up/down arrow keys control the
width of the beam. When the beam is wide, it's range is short, and the further
away things are, they "fuzzier" they are. As you narrow the beam, the objects
become less fuzzy. At a certain point, when things are un-fuzzed enough, you
get some information about the ship, like it's name, position, bearing, range,
heading, shield strength and wavelength characteristics. You can also zoom the
science scope in and out using the mouse scroll wheel.

<p>The "dotted" lines in the above still picture are kind of moving around and
a bit more lively than they look in this picture, but you can't see it in a
still shot.
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DBYiI.png">
<p>Above is the engineering screen. There are 4 gauges: RPM, Fuel, Power, and
Temperature. The idea is you have some sort of "engine" consuming "fuel" and
producing "power" which can be distributed to the various systems. The power is
a function of rpm and temperature. The sliders are used to distribute the power
around the ship. The power distribution part doesn't really do anything yet
(but the sliders work.)
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C13Up.png">
<p>Last, is the debug screen, which shows a map of the universe. The white dots
(or, X's, if you look really closely) represent computer controlled ships. They
are clustered around the "starbases" because the AI for these ships at the
moment consists of "go sit near the nearest starbase."

<p>Also, difficult to show, when you start up each client you can specify which
"roles" it will fulfill -- science, weapons, navigation, etc. ("all" is an
option.) Additionally there is a "soundserver" role, so that sounds which are
global to the ship -- e.g. being hit by a photon torpedo -- can be directed to
the system that is connected to the big stereo. Sounds also may be directed to
individual stations -- so you could get distinctive science-y beeping noises
from the science station laptop, and weapons-y noises from the weapons stations
etc. Not that any of those sounds are in there yet, but the infrastructure to
do it is there in the code.

<p>No 3d "thru the window" view yet --- if I do it, it will be a totally
software z-buffered flat-shaded triangle renderer that looks like it's from a
1982 silicon graphics workstation. You'd probably rather someone besides me
programs that bit, lol. As would I, as would I.

<p>-- steve

<p>p.s. Not getting a lot of feedback... wonder if I'm wasting my time creating
a game that requires you get together 4-6 of your linux/startrek nerd friends
on a LAN to play, lol. Well, it's a fun waste of time programming the thing,
and, I am learning a bit doing it, so... I'll keep at it. I do worry that the
various stations won't actually be *fun enough* though -- trying to program in
some "fun", but, also keeping to the spirit of the thing -- the "fun" may
depend more on the personality of the participants than on the game content for
this sort of game, not sure.

<p>3D would be great on the long term.
 <hr>
<p><b>smcameron 25 Nov 2012, 20:01</b>
<p>Well... probably if I switched from basic gtk/gdk line drawing and so on to
cairo, compositing a backdrop image -- even scalable -- would be possible,
similar to Dueling Masters of Space Time.
http://smcameron.github.com/dueling-mas ... pace-time/ Performance might be
iffy on low end machines, but, eh, it'd probably be ok. To some extent, I think
the "looks" of the thing aren't necessarily all that important, what's
important is that is should be "fun", and fun and looks are not necessarily
correlated, and maybe a lot of the "fun" of this particular game may come from
the people playing it, we'll see, I guess.

<p>The one place I think that the looks probably do matter quite a bit would be
in the as-yet-unimplemented 3d "out the window" viewscreen.

<p>I need to hurry up and get things far enough along that I can get some
people together to play it and see what it's like.

<p>I wouldn't worry too much about the looks, I didn't mean it in a critical way.

<p>This looks exciting! What self-ironic name. :) (It might make sense to make
some things in the game nerdy-funny-ironic, rather than nerdy-serious, too.
in-game warning messages perhaps.)

<p>The look is quite TTY-retro but dark-blue-on-black is very bad to read. I recommend light blue instead for the weapons screen.

<p><b>Skorpio 26 Nov 2012, 20:25</b>
<p>I've been working on some new top-down spaceships (and mechs), just for fun,
and wondered if you have a use for them. Or are you going for a more abstract
look and 3D graphics for the screen? If you want 3D ships, then you could
probably utilize the shipyard on OGA.

<p>Btw, I think the term phaser is protected and you should better replace it.

<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 26 Nov 2012, 22:29</b>

<p>I'm probably going for a more abstract thing than those top-down views. The
shpyard may come in handy when I get to the 3d stuff. (I have vague notions of
metaprogramming OpenSCAD to procedurally generate spaceship models, but haven't
thought very hard about it.)

<p>As far as "phasers" being a protected term... I'm a little skeptical. Games
like Netrek (<a href="http://www.netrek.org/">http://www.netrek.org/</a> )
contain "phasers" ( <a href="http://www.netrek.org/beginner/newbie.php">http://www.netrek.org/beginner/newbie.php</a>)
, as do all the old text based star trek games. If a lawyer writes me a scary
letter, I'll worry about it then.

<p>For now, getting the game into a playable state (and I think the 3d view is
not strictly needed for that) is the highest priority.

<blockquote>

<p>Well, as a start, various ships will attack various starbases, as well as
your ship, so you try to intervene, etc. and stay alive.

<p>Additionally, multiple player-controlled starships may inhabit a server, so
either cooperative or combative play is possible. "Space" being kind of wide
open (and in my implemenation) kind of two dimensional, there's not much
opportunity to hide-n-seek, or have elaborate strategies that I can think of
for multi-ship combat. Will have to think about some ways to liven that up and
make things more interesting.

<p>Farther than that, I haven't really given it much thought, just trying to
get the game to a playable state for now.

<p>If you have some particular ideas, feel free to share, but of course I can't
guarantee I'll ever get around to implementing any of them.

<p>Ideas that allow simple things to be combined in interesting ways that lead
to some interesting emergent behavior are probably the best, but that is kind
of a tall order.

(FDesktopRecorder is the one I find the best for Linux). Also, if you find

<p>+1 for openscad. I'm aware of brlcad and it's history for a some time btw.
<p>But for programmers openscad seems like an awesome tool - again because I'm a fan of parametric and procedural design.
<p>On the other hand maybe I've missed similar features in brlcad?
<p>Can it do CSG operations like intersection, subtraction and addition on 3D geometry and that parametrically scripted with macro/modules

<p>Would be nice if you can surprise me.

<p>Edit: The MGED Quick Reference card shows a brlcad programming example with variables, loops and conditions.
But openscad seems 'turing' complete, looks familiar and decomposition into modules (like C functions) is simple and obvious, too.

<blockquote>

<p>I'm a big fan of openSCAD as well. I'm not actually sure whether it's turing
complete or not. It does have some pretty severe limitations (e.g. the
"variables" you get in openSCAD act more like constants than like variables.)
For this reason, I came up with openCSCAD, which is a tiny little C library for
outputting openSCAD code. (It's kind of a neat little hack at best, and a
useless piece of crap at worst, lol.) It does technically get you nice things
like real variables, recursion etc. but at the cost of massive openscad file
output which may or may not really be processable by openscad. (e.g. the tree
picture on that page was done by screen shotting after pressing F5, not F6. F6
in openscad actually does all the reall CSG stuff, and doing all the
intersections of all those branches, etc... well, you may or may not live long
enough to see that computation run to completion.)

<p>Haven't yet looked at BRLCAD, as I have no pressing need, and it looks a bit daunting.

<hr>
<p><b>hc 12 Jan 2013, 23:12</b>

<p>Hm, assumed that recursion in OpenSCAD would work - which would still make
it a more or less complete functional programming language for solids even
without variables - but it didn't work. It gave no errors for module-recursion
but didn't work as expected, duplicating and renaming the duplicate method code
did of course. Yes, seems pretty static compile time and incomplete but for
technical/mechanical models it should be enough.  As for BRL-CAD: Can't imagine
a tank having fractal structures ... unless for stealth someday ;)

<p>Yeah, generating code from code is of course an option - besides openSCAD's code-editor isn't the best.
OpenSCAD's loops should suffice most of the time, I think I'll try when in need of recursive structures.


<p>Wouldn't mind if Admins would move this discussion about tools somewhere
else - don't want to divert from the interesting work in progres topic.

<p>Yes. I'm pretty sure the openSCAD developers know this, because they provided a
"hide editor" option, and the F3 key reloads the source file. What I do is have
vim going in another window, and switch between the two with alt-tab. Save from
vim, alt-tab to openscad, F3, then F6, then alt-tab back to vim -- that is
essentially the "edit compile debug edit" cycle for me with openscad.

Brian Rubin:

</blockquote>

<p>Ok....

<p>Inspiration, well obviously Artemis, as I've mentioned. I've never played it
myself, but I've seen youtube videos, and it seemed like a cool idea, and not
having (nor wanting) a windows machine, I figured, well, I guess I've got to
make my own version. This is a bit of a pattern for me, as another game, or
more like a novelty than a game which I made, called "Be The Wumpus" came in to
existence in the same way -- taking the kernel of an idea of an existing
Windows-only game and making my own version of it. Of course, the Star Trek TV
series also informed the design of the game to an extent -- same as it did for
Artemis, presumably.


<p>Time spent working on it... hmm, well, as the painters say, my whole life up
to this point. Well, I first began working on the network part of it, in the
form of a generic lobby server which can be found here:
https://github.com/smcameron/ssgl although that code is out of date and buggy
compared to the variant which is found within SNIS -- need to fix that, I
suppose -- about 2 years ago I guess (according to github). I got bogged down
with that when I couldn't figure out how to do NAT punchthrough for
peer-to-peer connections. So that lay fallow for a couple of years. But, the
initial impetus for the lobby server was to make a game similar to Artemis, and
that would have been in the fall of 2010, when I first became aware of Artemis.
But, I got bogged down in the NAT punchthrough, and Christmas rolled around,
and vacation, and I got distracted, and just dropped it. I think I also had
some of the network code for SNIS partially done (but buggy as hell) at that
time. But in any case, I dropped it at the end of 2010.


<p>And then, in November of 2012, there was a "hackathon" at Platform Houston (
http://www.platformhouston.com/ ) and I knew one of the guys involved in that
place, so I said sure, I'll go to this hackathon, which was a 2-day weekend
thing, see what you can cook up in two days. So I was kind of fishing around
for ideas of what to do, and I thought of this old idea of doing a variant of
Artemis, and I remembered Space Nerds in Space that I had started back in 2010,
so I thought, ok, let me pick up that ball again.


<p>So I spent a couple days of hard programming getting that onto it's feet.
So, all the infrastructure work that I did in 2010, building the lobby code,
and the network code, that, by itself, did nothing, and was quite a lot of
drudgery to write (all C code, from scratch, not much in the way of pre-made
libraries, just because, that's how I roll, usually, not for any good reason
other than sheer pigheaded stubbornness, really) -- all that work served me
pretty well, and having taken that long break, well, I got the thing to where
you could 'drive" and "shoot", and had several different "screens" all
potentially separate processes communicating via network working in those 2
days. And of course I re-used a lot of ideas and code -- esp. the font system
-- from Word War vi -- so the graphics kind of have that look -- everything is
drawn with lines, so everything is scalable. One thing that has always
irritated me is when you start up a game and it's at a fixed resolution, and
esp. old games written for low-res systems that now look tiny on modern
systems, so I tend to make my games scale. Anyway, I digress.


<p>So, over Thanksgiving I had a good solid week off work, and put that to use
on SNIS, and made a lot of good progress. Most recently, I've gotten bogged
down in the 3d graphics aspects. This is probably a mistake, in several ways.
First, I was trying to make my own software 3d renderer. It soon became clear
that 1) debugging the thing is really hard for me, 2) it's not fast enough. So
there are a couple possible solutions to that, one would be to use gtkglext to
do the graphics and well, I'd have a different set of bugs (that I would
presumably create) to worry about and lose some portability, but it should be
plenty fast, and the other possibility is just use a wireframe renderer
(already done, mostly) and don't worry about making the 3d graphics all fancy.
If it's good enough for Elite on the old BBC micro, then it's just plain good
enough, right? :) Esp. considering the game is fundamentally a 2D game, so the
3D graphics are somewhat superfluous, *except*, for that starship bridge
experience with a big projection screen, you've got to have some kind of "out
the window" view, right?


<p>As far as planned features, well, I suppose I would aim for the minumum set
of features that will make a fun game, as a start. That is, each station has
got to have enough for the players to do, and behave in ways that encourage
cooperation between "crewmembers", the crew has got to be able to get their
ship into interesting and dangerous situations and be able to get out of them
(or not) in some kind of interesting and fun way, and basically have something
to do, other than merely mindlessly driving and shooting.


<p>The game as it stands today is not ready to be reviewed or played. For
starters, there are some bugs that need fixing first, but there is quite a lot
else that needs doing.


<p>In the last few weeks, I've been distracted from SNIS, (adding shiny laser
projector support to Word War vi, and other little amusements).


<p>But, I hope to get back to SNIS development soon.

<p>Feel free to ask more questions.

will it take someone to fix a system while ignoring the rest of the interface?

<p>You may be right. We'll see. Once I had the idea, I couldn't get it out of
my head any quicker way than by implementing it. An "autonomous mode" in which
the robot performs his functions by himself is probably a good idea, if for no
other reason than it might be hard to get enough crewmembers together to play
all the stations.

<p>Yeah, I too thought this felt like an overly-repetitive chore. I would
really not want to go through this minigame more than once to fix my spaceship.

<p>You know what would be better? If you install new stuff on your ship and
manually lug them around (fixing should, preferably, be automated). It would
definitely... personalise your ship more. I envision something like Secret
Bases in Pokemon games (I know, I know...) where you can put useful things as
well as decorate the place with gratuitous plants and tables and chairs and so
on.
<hr>
<p><b>JeffM2501 21 May 2013, 17:14</b>
<p>Componentization is a good thing but I think you are pondering the wrong
aspects of it. What I think would be fun would be to build up a ship from a set
of modules that contain equipment. So you can upgrade your Warp, or beams, or
add more missile tubes.


<p>These type of games don't really let you walk around the ship to see tables
and chairs, the idea is that your physical computer screen is the console you
use as a crew member of the ship and the 3d view you see is ether out the
window, or in this case a camera above the engineering bay (that somehow
magically can follow the robot)
<hr>
<p>Part of my motivation for the whole "damcon arena" as I call it, was to
provide something for the players to say to each other.

<p>I imagine:

<p>Captain: "How's that warp drive repair coming, Scotty?"

<p>Scotty: "Fine, I just have to get the transient wormhole suppressor reinstalled and we should be good to go."

<p>And Scotty wouldn't just be merely "repeating what the computer says" (a la
galaxy quest), he would actually _mean_ that he really was trying to re-install
the transient wormhole suppressor into the warp drive in the game.

<p>Whether that's really good enough reason, and whether it's worth while... I
don't really know. I'll think about it some more.

<P>It's also arguable that I haven't succeeded in getting very far away from
having the player just "repeating what the computer says" in that the names I
came up with are obviously just pseudo-space-jargon gibberish with no actual
meaning or relevance.

<p>There's no view frustrum culling, so things which are behind the camera show
up upside down and reversed. If someone well versed in the ways of the 3D

<p>Tried to do a multiplayer run at Houston's hackerspace, TX/RX Labs today,
but ran into technical issues with the network. It seems the machine hosting
the server process would randomly get re-assigned a new IP address. Needless to
say any TCP connections established with the old IP address ceased to work. The
projector screen was also terribly washed out due to it being the daytime and
light flooding in through the skylights. Maybe next week will be more
successful.

<p>BTW, in case people want to try this game (in its current unfinished state),
but don't have enough linux-using friends, here's how you make a bootable live
dvd containing the game that can be run on windows machines without disturbing
it at all, which is what I had done for the above picture, as all those
machines are windows boxes. This does assume a 32-bit Mint 13 linux install
(you could install it in a vm to make the dvds, I guess.) This worked for me...
if it doesn't work for you, well, you're probably on your own for now.
<blockquote>
<pre>
 Install the package "mintconstructor" from the repositories
   sudo apt-get install mintconstructor

    Open a terminal
    Type sudo /usr/lib/linuxmint/mintConstructor/mintConstructor.py
    In the mintconstructor window that opens:
   In the "Directory" field, choose a directory for the ISO (use a new
   directory with nothing in it for this) Make sure to select the
   "New project" radio option
        Click the browse button on the right of the "ISO file" field and
   point it to your ISO file
   (in my case I used linuxmint-13-cinnamon-dvd-32bit.iso  from here: http://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=105
        Click "Next" and then "Yes" to confirm.

    Wait for it to do its thing for a bit, then click the button it
    presents to open a chrooted environment (it opens an xterm).  In
    the xterm:

    apt-get install build-essential
    apt-get install portaudio19-dev
    apt-get install libvorbis-dev
    apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
    apt-get install git
    apt-get install stgit
    apt-get install openscad

If the openscad package isn't around, you can get it from here:
http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html
 and then from outside the chrooted environment, copy
openscad-2013.0.x86-32.tar.gz into your chroot directory/root
   Then, back in the chrooted xterm:

   cd /root
   tar xzvf openscad-2013.01.x86-32.tar.gz
   cd openscad-2013.01/
   ./install.sh
   cd ..

   git clone https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git
   cd space-nerds-in-space/
   make

   (now Space Nerds in Space has been built within the chrooted env.)

    Once you're finished making modifications, make sure to clean up with the following commands:


    Now clean up the chrooted env (and yes aptitude takes the weird
    tilde options for some reason):

    aptitude purge ~c
    aptitude unmarkauto ~M
    apt-get clean; rm -rf /var/cache/debconf/*.dat-old; rm -rf /var/lib/aptitude/*.old; rm -rf /var/lib/dpkg/*-old; rm -rf /var/cache/apt/*.bin; updatedb
    history -c
    rm /root/.bash_history
    rm /root/.nano_history
    history -c
    exit

(xterm will close)

    Click Next
    Give your ISO a description (which will be embedded as the name of the CD
or USB stick onto which the ISO is burnt)  Don't pick too long of a name though
because if you do, it won't work.
    Click Next

Iso image will be made
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Then to run the game, burn the iso to dvd several times, and boot up all your machines from dvd.

<p>Open up a terminal, type "sudo su -"
<p>(no password -- it's a live dvd)

<p>Then, cd to space-nerds-in-space

<p>Has to be root because we installed spacenerds in space into /root/space-nerds-in-space above when
making the dvd -- this could be worked around by chowning it all to user "mint", perhaps putting it someplace
else before making he ISO image, but I don't have the exact instructions to do that, and didn't think to do it,but
if you're paranoid, you probably want to think about that.

<p>Repeat for several machines on your lan, say, five of them or so.

<p>On one machine that is connected to a projector, note the IP address:
(run ifconfig to figure this out.)

<p>Then start the snis client:

<p>./snis_client

<p>From there, start the lobby server on localhost, start the gameserver, connect to lobby, and connect to the gameserver.
<p>Note the shipname and password you use (make up what you want).

<p>On the remaining machines, start snis_client, replace the lobby host "localhost" with the ip address noted above, fill in only the shipname and password as above, and connect to the lobby, then to the gameserver. You can be choosy about the 'roles' for each station at this point, but you don't have to.

<p>That's it.

<p>edit: btw, prior to making live dvd iso's and burning a bunch of dvds, we tried to run the game in linux installed to virtual machines on the windows boxes -- that didn't work out so well, performance was kind of crap for whatever reason. With the dvds, performance was fine at least for the few minutes the network was working.

now since the game is still in a really rough state as far as playability goes.

start when the server process crashed with an assert inside pthread_mutex_lock
(no doubt a glibc bug ;-). Moved the server to another machine and ran it under
valgrind, and we played the game for about an hour with it running under
valgrind, which found nothing. Lots of rough edges with the game play that need
tuning, not to mention all the functionality that isn't in the game yet, but,
it's very good to finally have it in a playable state, more or less.

<p>The video's a bit dark, and esp. the projector screen doesn't show up very
well, next time I'll bring the DSLR, maybe that will help.

<p><b>smcameron 12 Jul 2013, 04:43</b>
<p>Just a progress update. Had a week off around July 4, and I used it to
totally re-vamp the power-system of the ship. Now all systems are modelled as a
resistive network with a fixed voltage, capped current power supply. So long as
the resistive load does not exceed the max current that can be supplied,
voltage is constant, and the requested power is delivered. When the load
requires more current than the supply can deliver, voltage drops, current
decreases. Gives a rather natural way to couple all the power consuming systems
together.

<p>Additionally, I've done a lot of work on the "DEMON" screen, and now, from
this screen, you can delete things from the universe, add things to the
universe, become a puppet-master for any non-player ship, able to drive it,
shoot the weapons, and transmit communications from any non-player ship. By
this means, you can act as game master and provide a little puppet show for the
rest of the players.

<p>Got side tracked a little bit... I was thinking about spaceship models, and
how making them by hand was difficult, and I remembered shipwright -- that
procedural spaceship generator that slams a bunch of canned, hand-made parts
together somewhat randomly, but in pairs, and in ways that maintain bilateral
symmetry, and I got inspired a little bit, though I was dissatisfied with the
results of shipwright -- which is here, btw: http://ship.shapewright.com/


<p>So, yesterday I started hacking on a little bit of openscad metaprogramming
to make me some freakin' spaceships.

<p>I called my program "ship not even wrong", (inspired by "shipwright", and by that famous quote of Wolfgang Pauli)

<p>My program is here:
<p>https://github.com/smcameron/opencscad -- in the ship-not-even-wrong
subdirectory. It relies on opencscad to produce openscad code, and of course on
openscad to process the models.

<p>Typically, a big ship will take 30000 triangles or something, so it's
probably not actually suited to Space Nerds In Space as it currently stands --
my poor little software renderer is brought to its knees by such large models.
Though I did manage to get some screen shots anyway.

<p>Incremental progress.

<p>I've added a "Tractor Beam" (that doesn't really work yet) and the Science
station can now view 3D models of whatever it's scanning, and now ships are not
all confined to the same flat plane, and I've started adding some lua scripting
abilities.

<p>Just a progress update. Converted to use opengl. I am however, still using
the software renderer, just all the 2D drawing (e.g. triangle fills) is done
with opengl. Plan is to replace the software renderer, but I'm not that far
along yet. Only real 3d stuff done with opengl so far is the skybox. Oh yeah, I
made a little (not very sophisticated) skybox program:
https://github.com/smcameron/cosmic-space-boxinator

<p>I also figured out how to get recordmydesktop to stop garbling the video
(use the --on-the-fly-encoding option.). Unfortunately it now garbles the
sound. So here's a silent video showing the new skybox.

<p>Not too much to report this week, other than that the lua scripting is
coming along and is now to the point that simple mission scripts are possible.
There are still a lot of entry points and callbacks and what not that would be
nice to have -- I'm taking it somewhat slowly to try to avoid an API explosion,
since I don't have a very good feel for the sorts of things which are a good
idea vs. a bad idea for such APIs, other than that it's probably better if the
lua API is small, rather than large.


<p>Here is a bit of documentation about the <a
href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt">Space
Nerds In Space lua API</a>, still subject to change obviously.

<p>Here are a couple of mission scripts I've made so far:

<p>* <a
href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/luascripts/TRAINING-MISSION-1.LUA">Training
misison 1</a> -- kind of a race around a circuit to dock with 4 starbases -- in
case it's not obvious (it isn't) the way to dock with a
starbase is get very close to it, then type "dock" in the comms screen. In
general, all the commnications from these scripts with the player occurs via
the comms screen.

<p>* <a
href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/luascripts/TRAINING-MISSION-2.LUA">Training
mission 2</a> -- the obvious mission, decoy mayday call leads to ambush.

<p>I am open to ideas about the sorts of things such an API should provide to
enable easier creation of a rich set of mission scripts, though I can't promise
to implement suggestions, obviously.

<p>Edit: Also, if anybody wants to take a whack at making a mission script or
two, by all means, please do, and if in so doing you run into things that the
API is missing that prevent you from being able to do what you want to do --
and are going to do -- let me know.

<p>There's a great tool for capturing opengl applications on linux, it's called
glc, and is hooking into the opengl api (LD_PRELOAD i believe) to do
high-performance screen captures, it also hooks into the audio subsystem, it
produces quite large raw files which can then be converted into
less-quite-large-files which can be read by tools such as ffmpeg to produce
nicely-sized-files.

<p>There is already some support for scripting missions with lua. It's still a
work in progress and I haven't filled in all the events and callbacks and
things or figured out what the best set of features for a scripting system are
-- taking it kind of slow in an attempt not to bloat the scripting API with
crap before I figure out what's really needed, though not having done something
like this before, It will probably end up with its share of warts anyway.


<p>You can see what the current (still subject to change) api is like here:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt</a>

<p>and some example scripts (that don't do a whole lot) here:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/tree/master/share/snis/luascripts">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/tree/master/share/snis/luascripts</a>

<p>Currently you run the scripts by going to the "demon" screen and typing eg.
"lua training-mission-1.lua" into the command box.

<p>Oh, that lua api looks neat, and the missions there shows it off well! :)

<p>I'm wondering if openscad is strictly required for building the game, does
it compile the model-files into a machine-specific format?

<p>It'd be great if the content-creation tools were only required for content
creators (most projects won't require photoshop or gimp to render .psd or .xcf
files into pngs during the build).


<p>That being said, after changing includepaths for lua, stuff compiles and
looks great! Definitely going to give scripting a go :)

<blockquote>
dusted:

</blockquote>

<p>Well, openscad is needed only to build the stl files from the scad files (to
state the obvious). I guess I don't make such a distinction in my mind between
"content-creation", and coding, esp. since "content-creation" with openscad
*is* coding. :)


<p>Originally I had dropped the stl files into github directly, but... they're relatively huge and they screwed up my graph, man... :)
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/graphs/code-frequency">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/graphs/code-frequency</a>
<p>See that giant spike around Dec 2012/Jan 2013? That's stl files. Then the giant negative spike in June 2013 is me getting rid of the stl files.

<p>Obviously if the game is built and packaged up into RPMs or .deb or
whatever, the stl files will be in there pre-built (presuming I don't move to
something more complicated allowing texturing, etc. at some point) but for what
goes into github as "source", I think having the scad files and not having the
stl files is the right decision.

<p>BTW, if you make any cool mission scripts, send me a patch/pull request.
And, if there's something you find yourself needing from the lua api that's not
there right now (quite likely) let me know and we can hash out what should be
done.

<p>That's fair enough, i wondered if maybe it was something like size.. :)

<p>I don't know if you're interested, but I've setup a build-server for SNIS

<p><b>smcameron 11 Oct 2013, 14:47</b>
<p>dusted, that's awesome, thanks!

<p>It's probably getting to be time to add a "dist" target to the makefile that
does more or less what your build script does.

<p>I have been thinking (not very much, but some) about what form this game
might best be distributed for people that just want to play it, rather than
hack on it, and I think this game is a little different than most. Since it's
(at the moment) a linux-only game, and since it requires several people to be
in the same location with a bunch of linux computers in order to play -- well,
that is a very tall order, and most people probably won't be able to meet it.
To help them meet it, we could build a bootable linux distro on a USB flash
drive image with the game on it. Then, all they do is download the image, blast
it onto a bunch of USB flash drives, boot up all their various computers from
the flash drive, et voila!

<p>Of course, to get into the business of distributing an entire linux distro,
while still compiying with the GPL to distribute source upon request, etc....
maybe there are complications with that. And in the unlikely event the thing
got popular, that could eat a lot of bandwidth. So, i dunno.
<hr>
<p><b>dusted 11 Oct 2013, 14:52</b>
<p>Building the dist needn't be much trouble, as a single link to the upstream
dist would suffice as "source" I think.
<p>Building a "going to work without
too much hassle" usb dist is likely more
difficult, maybe based on knoppix or another of the live-dists

<p>I'm glad it may be useful, I'll follow the project and update the buildscript accordingly to the makefile changes. :)
<p>I'm using ccache to speed up compilation, so the CC parameter is useful.
<p>The server is on a 100 mbit upload, so it can handle a bit of traffic, and
you're free to deeplink to the files, I've configured it to keep latest 10
builds, so using the "lastSuccess" link is propably useful.

<p>Sorry for spamming, wanted to say that fresh 32 and 64 bit binaries can be downloaded here, these may not be correctly packaged, please correct me if I've made any mistakes.
<p>I also implemented a simple caching system for the stl files from the scad files, so those will only be generated if they change.
<p>These builds are not officially supported and I've made them on my own initiative, so if you have trouble with them, complain to me first.

<p>It's been a little while since I posted an update, and if you've only been
casually watching the github page, you might have thought not much was going
on, but if you dug a little deeper, you'll have seen that there's plenty going
on, just not on the "master" branch.


<p>It's been just a little over a year since I began this thread with the bare
beginnings of a network game. In the original conception, the game was
primarily a 2-dimensional game that happened to have a 3-d "out the window"
view. Since then, and esp. in the last month, a lot of progress has been made
in turning this primarily 2-dimensional game into a real 3-dimensional game.
It's been a heavy battle, and many matrices have been manipulated and
quaternions grokked.


<p>So, here's a little update video showing some of the new stuff. It's still
not really ready for prime time, but in case you want to play with the new toys
anyway, the code is on the "more-coord-fixing" branch on github.

<p>A quick suggestion, but I don't know whether you already implemented
something like that already.

<p>Why not add (simulated) non-bridge crew? They can get wounded or even die
when their post gets hit. Each crew member could have its own qualities, making
it suited for a certain posting.

<p>If crew starts getting wounded or (god forbid) start dieing, the system(s)
they are posted start running less smoothly or stop getting repaired. This
makes sure the bridge crew is more careful with the ship.

<p>When the ship is running smoothly, the non-bridge crew can spend time
optimizing the various systems of the ship. Causing the various ship systems to
slowly improve in effectiveness.

<p>Crew could be shuffled around, to affect things like repair or (re)charge time.

<p>Thanks for the idea, I will consider it. I am afraid though that there are many
higher priority things which will need to be done before I can get to that. If
I make a list of all the things that need to be done before I can have
something which is a complete and playable game, there are many sort of "basic
functionality" things that remain to be done, and at least to some extent, I
try to choose what I work on with the goal of getting to a complete game in

<p>This looks fantastic! It's amazing to browse this topic and see how far
you've progressed. I noticed some of your videos had classical music playing in
the background, but are you planning to add any other music at some point?
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 13 Dec 2013, 13:32</b>
<p>Hi, and thanks for the kind words. There is a more cool stuff coming soon.

<p>As for music, I'm not sure. In the very early days of home computers, just
making any sound at all was a novelty, and if your game could play music, or --
oh miracle! -- even *talk*, this was quite a neat thing. Nowadays, that sort of
novelty is gone, as computers can easily reproduce any sound, or video, or what
have you. So, in one way of thinking about it, it doesn't make sense any more
to have some particular music to go with the game, any more than your
automobile should have a theme song to go with it that starts up every time you
drive it (well, even that might be cool for a little while, but only because
your car would be the *only* car with such an absurd thing, but it would still
wear thin.)

<p>Now I am quite aware that music is a powerful thing for setting a mood, and
ideally, we'd all have John Williams in our game room conducting an orchestra
performing an extemporaneous composition which varies seamlessly on the fly to
suit whatever is happening in the game, like a real time film score. But that's
not happening, of course. Next best, we might have some music composed that is
broken into little component pieces that can be mixed and matched on the fly to
make a kind of robotic simulation of John Williams piecing together something
to suit the game play. This is really hard, although there have been some
attempts (iMuse springs to mind: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMUSE ) Doing
something like that is likely beyong my abilities, and even if it weren't, it
probably wouldn't be that good. Next best, we can just strap some canned music
into the game (e.g.: Brahms Tragic Overture seems like a reasonable fit, and
there is a fairly decent free recording around:
<a href="https://musopen.org/music/1567/johannes-brahms/tragic-overture-op-81/">
https://musopen.org/music/1567/johannes-brahms/tragic-overture-op-81/</a>
) However, this gets old
on repeated exposure, and is not really much superior to just letting the
player cue up whatever he likes on his media player of choice in the
background.

<p>So now I'm down to maybe I just provide a "suggested listening" list to
accompany the game? You could do worse than to just crank up Pandora and type
in "john williams" and let 'er rip.

<p>-- steve

<p><b>andrewj 14 Dec 2013, 11:53</b>

OpenGL shaders and such within the Space Nerds In Space codebase, we now how
alpha-blending texture-mapping shaders to render lasers, torpedoes and sparks
and such, and I'm sure more exciting and beautiful things will be coming soon.

<p>Other changes: The damage control robot can actually repair stuff now too. A
lot of improvement to the client side object movement interpolation code was
done as well, so things move a lot more smoothly than they previously did. Lots
of other small miscellaneous changes too numerous to mention, consult the
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/commits/master">history</a>
if you need more (too much) detail.

<p>On another topic: I know a few people are trying to run this thing on
Raspberry Pis. It was never really a design goal that it should run on
Raspberry Pis, though I was happy to see people try it, esp. back before any
OpenGL code was added. Now that the OpenGL barn door is opened though, it
appears to be leaking into many of the screens besides just the "Main Screen"
(Nav, Weapons, and Science, for example.) I do not see this trend abating as
development continues, the sexy graphics are just too alluring. Much as I like
the idea of SNIS on Rasp. Pi, the little machine may simply not be sufficiently
powerful for it.

<p>Space Nerds In Space April 2014 Development update.

<P>Kind of slacking off lately in terms of committing code to Space Nerds In
Space. That's ok, it's expected that there will be occasional lulls in momentum
for any hobby project of this size. Look at Word War vi -- plenty of gaps in
the commit history when enthusiasm waned.

<p>Anyway, I have by no means abandoned the project. Here's a little video of
what's new this month:

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJRhO7ur8YA" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJRhO7ur8YA&feature=youtu.be</a>

<p>The audio isn't sync'ed to the video, and the video runs out before the audio finishes, ... oh well.

<p>Most notably, I've been getting into emulating some fluid dynamics stuff to try
to get decent textures for gas giant planets. I've made some progress mostly by
pursuing the ideas in this paper: <a
href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph2007-curlnoise.pdf">Curl
Noise For Procedural Fluid Flow</a> by Bridson, Hourihan and Nordenstam. You
can the current state of my experiments here: <a href="https://github.com/smcameron/curly-vortex">Curly Vortex on github</a>.

<p>What it looks like in game so far (this is not committed because I'm not yet satisfied with it.)
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0NeWGFN.png">
<p>The fluid flows on that planet image were simulated (faked) on 6 square
faces of a cube arranged in a field of perlin noise with particles moving to
adjacent faces when they leave another face. This works ok, but not great,
leaving visible artifacts (though less artifacts than wrapping a seamless
rectangle around a sphere). It also does not work well if you want to introduce
belts of counter rotating flows parallel to the equator of the planet -- things
get a little too tricky for me near the edges of faces and on the top and
bottom squares of the cube. I think the better way to do it is do the flows in
real 3d on the surface of the sphere, then generate the cube map textures from
that data, which is what I'm currently working on, but it's not really there
yet.

In the mean time, here some examples of 2D fluid flows with horizontal bands of
flows alternating between left and right with chaotic zones between. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/MomQL#vMtQwyo">imgur

<p>Yeah, I think I know how to do it, just need to actually do it, and debug
it. I don't think I can run the sim on the faces of the cube map easily, or I
can't figure out how to get rid of velocity discontinuities at the edges of the
faces, and it makes doing counter rotating velocity bands more complicated than
I can deal with. After trying for awhile I have concluded it would be easier to
do the sim in 3d proper, and get the cubemap images from the 3d data.
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 28 Apr 2014, 04:52</b>
<p>So I have spent the last several days trying to do a proper 3D version of my fake fluid flow stuff.

<p>Having some problems.

<p>1. Cannot seem to get a divergence free velocity field on the surface of a
sphere like I can for a 2D plane. Not totally sure why. Might have to do with
error deciding if the noise gradient is "uphill" or "downhill". Adding a fudge
factor to correct (somewhat) for one error in that area helped (reduced
divergence) but what i thought should be a perfect correction was worse than
the fudge factor. So... yuck. Not sure what's going on there.

<p>2. Still have issues with discontinuities at cubemap face boundaries. Drat.
The whole point of doing the sim in real 3D was to get rid of those. Haven't
really tried to debug that, might turn out to be something simple, but... not
happy to see those discontinuities.

<p>3. libpng sucks. :) The initial particle colors are taking from an starting
image. Right now that image must be 1024x1024 or it won't work. That's due to
me not being able to figure out wtf is going on with libpng. Seems like it
should be simple, but... it is the exact opposite of simple. Or I'm suffering
some kind of brain lock on the issue, I don't know. Spent entirely too much
time on it before just manually scaling the input image to the same size as the
output images and giving up on that aspect for the time being. (if 1 and 2
can't be solved, 3 doesn't matter.)

<p>Oh, btw, if you want to play with this mess, I checked it into master of
space-nerds-in-space repo on github. The program is gaseous-giganticus. You
will need a 1024x1024 png image as a starting point in the current directory
that is named "gas.png" (you have to make this yourself. I suggest some cropped
image of sedimentary rock formations from arizona found by google image search.
Antelope canyon is also a good gis term. but anything will do, so long as it is
cropped/scaled to 1024x1024 and name gas.png.) Then it will dump out (and
overwrite, many times) files called tmpg-0.png (and 1,2,3,4,5 as well as 0).
You can view those with, e.g. gqview or other image viewing program, and also
mapped onto a sphere with mesh_viewer (part of space nerds in space code) by
"mesh_viewer -p tmpg-" command.

<p>A pic of one cube map face output. The gray areas, and esp. gray areas
bordered by black with particles leaving the area are the divergences.

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ieO23PX.png">

<p>And on a sphere:

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MR82L8j.png">

<p>Those are with, iirc, 1M particles. 8M particles looks a bit better
(divergences are somewhat hidden by the mass of particles.)

stbi_load at stuff and you get an array of pixels back). That's, unless you got

<p>Hi,

<p>I've recently discovered Space Nerds In Space, and I'm totally impressed,
but i can't shake the feeling that it wouldn't be amiss to suggest the author
of SNIS take a(nother?) look at a GPL'd game called Pioneer Space Sim
(<a href="http://pioneerspacesim.net">http://pioneerspacesim.net</a>)..

<p>Both SNIS and Pioneer are GPL'd games. It seems like they should.. like.. go
on a date, maybe.. at least flirt a little.

<p>It would be a wonderful path to greatly expand the universe SNIS is shaping
up to take place in, and it would certainly benefit Pioneer to have an angle on
becoming an excellent multiplayer game...

<p>anyway, i just wanted to register, and put my two cents in on it. These are
both incredibly good works of space nerdery, I thoroughly enjoy both games,
it'd be a shame if they didn't at least know about each other.. maybe some
sexting?

<p>Alas, i am not much of a developer myself. I have no way to assess both
codebases and know how surmountable any integration might be.. For all i know,
from a coding standpoint, it's a ridiculous suggestion.. It's.. just.. the
conditions both games exist under.. the general rising climate of the
popularity of space nerdery.. it's.. now just seems like an amazing time to
suggest such.. um.. couplings..

<p>as a space nerd reveling in this sudden outburst of awesome games (on linux,
no less) out in the world, just imagine for a moment...

I'm aware of Pioneer. Merging the projects isn't going to happen for a variety
of technical reasons, and I'll leave it at that. That being said, I have from
time to time peeked at their shader code, and they're welcome to use, for
example, my gas giant planet texture generator if they wanted to.

<p>Hi Charlie. Sorry about the radio silence on the SNIS front. I have been
looking for a job lately, so that has taken up all of my time for the past
month. As far as "... crap version of SNIS!" LOL! If you take a look again at
the very first post in this very thread you'll notice that this "crap version
of SNIS", called "Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Simulator" is in fact one and the
same as the very inspiration for SNIS. And before I even got very far with it,
I emailed Thom Robertson to be sure he was ok with me re-using the same basic
idea -- not that doing so was necessary, but it just seemed a decent thing to
do. With his blessing, I proceeded with SNIS.
<hr>
<p><b>Pollux568 13 Dec 2014, 19:25</b>
<p>Hi smcameron,

<p>just a small note to say that I discovered the concept of bridge simulator
with Artemis last year. Then I've heard about the SNIS project, and I have been
really really interested. There are some features which makes this game more
interesting than Artemis in my point of view, above all the full 3D
displacement, the far bigger world with more realistic distances, the feeling
of an alive world (with many ships). And the total compatibility with Linux
(I've tested it on my Linux Mint distribution, works perfectly :) ).

<p>One thing prevents me however to organize LAN party on the subject, it is
the lack of missions/objectives (but I might have missed a point). Although it
is an open world sandbox game, it could be interesting to have global
objectives (for example, destroy an enemy base or escort another ship).

<p>I can't wait for further improvements of the game, keep motivated, it is worth !
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron » 21 Dec 2014, 05:02</b>
<p>Hello Pollux568, and thanks for the kind words.

<p>I am aware of the lack of missions, etc. within SNIS. There is some
capability for missions, but it is a bit, let's say half-baked and
under-documented.

<p>If you switch to the "demon screen", and type in "lua abc.lua", and if there
is a script in share/snis/luascripts named ABC.LUA (has to be uppercase -- you
could consider that a bug) it will run the script, which can do many things.
There are some example scripts in share/snis/luascripts which you may want to
take a look at.

<pre>
CLEAR_ALL.LUA
COLLISION.LUA
HELLO.LUA
initialize.lua
SAVING-PLANET-ERPH.LUA
SILLY-SPACE-BATTLE.LUA
TRAINING-MISSION-1.LUA
TRAINING-MISSION-2.LUA
</pre>
So, for example, you can go to the "demon screen" and type "lua
saving-planet-erph.lua" and it will run that script. You can take a look at the
scripts and potentially make your own missions. Documentation (what there is of
it) for what the scripts can do is in lua-api.txt See:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt</a>
My hope was that users might create some mission scripts for SNIS. The api
isn't set in stone yet though, but I do try to not break the api unnecessarily
and not adding stupid things to the api that will need to be changed later
(time will tell if I am successful at not breaking it.)

So I guess what I am saying is that I'm aware of the lack of missions, and have
tried to put in some infrastructure to allow missions be built for the game.
The missions generally have to make heavy use of the comms system to be able to
inform the player of what is supposed to do (generally, making starbases
pretend to make requests for the players to go do stuff.) I am not sure how
well that scheme really works, but I'm not sure how else to do it.

On another topic, to explain the lack of development activity on SNIS lately,
about 3 months ago, in an interesting twist, I ended up not having a job for a
bit, and spent about a month getting a new job -- which worked out pretty well,
I think, since I did get a job at, of all places, GOOGLE! So, for the last 2
months, I have been doing nothing but trying to get my house ready to sell so
that I can move across the country. Consequently, for the last 3 months, I have
not worked on Space Nerds In Space at all. Once I start working again (in about
2 weeks!), I expect it will likely eat my brain for quite a while until things
settle down to some sense of normalcy at which time maybe I can get back to
working on SNIS some more.

Thanks for giving SNIS a try.

<p>So, getting settled in at my new job, had some time today to play around
with gaseous-giganticus, the procedural gas giant texture generation program
that is part of Space Nerds In Space, and so I made a little video about how to
use it. Well, the audio isn't sync'ed to the video, and the video runs too fast
(which, in this case is probably a good thing as it's a demo of a rather
compute intensive and slow program.) This lets you get to see it actually
working, instead of only still shots of the output of the program, which might
be interesting.

<p>I have made a fun little experiment with morphing nebulae. It is right now only
a half-baked implementation in that the morphing happens entirely on the client
and no attempt is made to keep different clients to have the same morphing
behavior so that all clients see a consistent view. It's a fairly subtle
effect, and I am not sure it's worth it in that it's really just something
that's fun for me as a programmer, but doesn't really add anything to the game
play, so this might not ever actually make it into the game.

<p>Refined the motion of the tentacles a bit... still not checked in.
Everything is done server side right now and network traffic is 3 quaternions
plus x,y,z for each joint of each tentacle -- 8 tentacles, 10 joints per
tentacle... 4 floats per quaternion... means 15 floats per joint * 80 joints *
4 bytes per float == 4800 bytes per spacemonster per update. Need to push a
bunch of this to the client side so it doesn't need to go over the network. So,
still just in the proof of concept stage at this point.

Vandar:

<p>It's not quite that easy. The "animation data" is procedurally generated on the
fly. The trick is to get all the clients to generate exactly the same data at
the same time, and allow for late joiners. It's not unsolvable, but not super
easy either. For now, I sidestep the problem by generated on the server once
and distributing to the clients -- I think I will continue to do it that way,
but find a way to drastically shrink what's generated on the server (e.g. maybe
I pass a new random seed around to all the clients to seed a per-creature
random number generator so the clients can all generated the same data at the
same time -- which is pretty much your same idea.)
<hr>
<p><b>Vandar 12 Apr 2015, 21:04</b>
<p>I've been using seeded procedural content generation in a few projects of mine,
and it works quite fine. So passing the seed and, if needed, additional
parameters to the rng of all clients will produce exactly the same outcome on
all clients - assuming that your messaging is monotone ordered, i.e. messages
are interpreted in the same sequence on all clients (clients still can lag
behind, important is only that the sequence is the same).

<p>Good luck :)

Following this project made me want to add a 3D flight module to my own space
exploration game variant. 5 hours learning OpenGL and looking at code examples,
und uncounted thoughts of swear-words later, I finally have the basics
together. Should be good enough to display something in between Elite and
Frontier style worlds, but I'm not sure if I'll go into procedural planet
generation like Frontier had it ... now I must couple the display module with
the rest of the game.
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 15 Apr 2015, 02:54</b>
<p>Cool. Adding 3D to a 2D game isn't easy for a variety of reasons. Enemy AI,
steering, shooting, etc. becomes harder. Making the gameplay fun becomes (to
me) more difficult. It's such a fundamental change that you risk damaging the
game, or adding so much complexity to it that you can't finish it. The one
piece of advice I'd offer is make sure you use consistent coordinate systems
everywhere -- that is, x, y, and z axes always point the same way and you
always use a consistent handedness of the coord systems used in the game
universe and in the rendering system -- Opengl is going to want to most
naturally use a particular coordinate system, don't fight it, modify your game
to use that coordinate system rather than converting between that coordinate
system and a different one within your game. Failing to do that when I first
began adding 3D to my game lead to untold hours of debugging insanity. My first
attempt failed because of this, and a 2nd attempt involved going back and
fixing the coordinate systems to be consistent, and I probably would have
failed a 2nd time if not for the help of my friend Jeremy -- or at least it
would have taken a lot longer than it did.
<hr>
<p><b>Vandar 15 Apr 2015, 10:48</b>
<p>Well, the history of the project is long ... briefly said, it's been 3D data
wise all the time, but there was only a map-like projection of space. No
enemies, no fights. It's about exploration. Now I'm adding a new view for the
data, showing space flight in 3D. Question is, if I want to use billboard
sprites for planets, or make them 3D models, furthermore if I want to use
procedural generation for the planets (which would be an interesting thing to
do). And I'm afraid, once there are visible planets in space, players will want
to land there.

<p>Finishing the project ... um, probably will never happen. I started in 1995
or so when I was fascinated by Elite II - Frontier, worked on it for a while,
had to dump a lot of code due to technology changes, started over with a new
code base, dumped the new codebase, resurrected parts of the old code,
translated it from C++ to Java and gave it a new Swing-based UI. At the moment
it's not about completing something but a "I want to see if this works", which
means embedding OpenGL in a Swing UI driven game. As a side effect I'm learning
more about OpenGL, but more or less unintended.

I am guessing from looking at this image:
http://forum.freegamedev.net/download/file.php?id=9300&mode=view that you are
using some noise to generate the terrain. How are you picking your colors? To
me it looks like your land is too "green" and your water is too light. I have
experimented some and had good luck with picking colors by indexing into a
color texture with one axis (in my case, vertical axis) being specified by
altitude, and the other axis being specified by a 3D noise function.  For land,
and water, respectively, these color picking textures worked pretty good:

<hr>
<p><b>Vandar 04 May 2015, 15:26</b>
<p>I'm using hand-coded color maps and simpex noise. I suspect that you have
both, superior color maps (the textures that you showed), but also a superior
noise function, or at least you make better use of your noise function, so that
it creates swirly structures and details like the rivers. Better color maps
will help my code, too, but adding more complexity to the noise function seems
to be a problem, I doubt the player wants to wait more than minute to have the
stellar system generated. Actually even 10 seconds of wait appear long ... but
with some time there will come ideas :)

<p>PS: I think the biggest difference is the fact that you have a 2-dimensional
color picking system, while I have a 1-dimensional one that only uses height.

<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 05 May 2015, 03:53</b>
<p>The rivers and things come about because in my heightfield generation code,
I sample real earth elevation data from images that I got from here:
<a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=73934">http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=73934</a>
and use it to modulate my
generated terrain E.g. I add a big circular pimple onto my planet, but then
essentially multiply the pimple heightfield by a sampled region of some real
terrain data, and keep doing that over and over. if the edges of the pimple I
am adding into the surface have height zero, then after muliplying, they're
still zero. Consequently it all fades together nicely, and I can add in
zillions of such wrinkly terrain-modulated pimples and it all blends together.
That part probably is pretty tough to do on the GPU I expect. Improving your
color picking is probably do-able though.

<p>My planets are precalculted too, so I could do a lot more detailed
calculations as well. At the moment creating the Werteizin system with its 24
bodies takes between 1 second and 20 seconds, depending on the texture size and
triangle count. One second is fine, 20 seconds stress the players patience
quite a bit. I'll try to improve my color maps, the last incarantions of some
planet types already look better than the early ones. Some others are in real
bad shape, though.

<p>Previously, I seem to recall someone suggesting that I should work on the
color scheme of the UI of Space Nerds In Space, as what's there now is a
somewhat haphazard mishmash of nominal primary and secondary named colors.
Well, I have not really revamped the colors, in fact they are currently the
same as they've always been. But, I have made it possible to modify the colors
of nearly every UI element independently via a simple config file. Well, it's
not as easy as it probably could be, and the names for all the ui elements are
probably slightly opaque, but it is tweakable by mere mortals. For example, In
a few minutes, I tweaked the colors of the Navigation screen to get this:
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3f0Dvbo.png">
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 13 Jul 2015, 07:55</b>
I cooked up a new system for docking with starbases. Now the NAV screen has a
button to engage or disengage docking magnets, and starbases can have docking
ports. When you approach a docking port with the magnets engaged, then you
dock. To undock, turn of the docking magnets. This still isn't complete -- but
the concept works at least.

<p>Another docking demo video. In the previous video, you could "dock" with a
docking port, but it didn't actually do anything -- to have the systems on your
ship repaired and replenished, you still had to dock the old way, which was
just to get on comms and request to dock while floating vaguely next to a
starbase. Now, requesting permission to dock via comms gets you only that --
permission to dock for a period of 3 minutes. During that three minutes, you
can dock with a docking port, and get your ships systems repaired and
replenished. If you don't dock within 3 minutes, the permission expires, and
you'll have to ask again. Attempting to dock without first asking permission
via comms won't work. Pressing F1 while on the navigation screen gives a
summary of the process.

<p>I think you need sdl-dev. e.g:

<p>Then "apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev".

<p>Well, the above is for ubuntu 14.04 (actually Mint 17 -- derived from ubuntu 14.04) which is different than what you're running, so, it might be different.
<p>Try "apt-cache search sdl-dev", and it will tell you which sdl-dev you need.

<p>In any case, I think sdl is only used by mesh_viewer, which is a tool for viewing models, but which is not actually used in the game. So you may be able to get by without sdl if you can get the build to proceed without mesh_viewer.

<p>As long as it builds snis_client and snis_server, and all the openscad models, if mesh_viewer isn't built, it won't stop the game from running.

environment. Granted, those instructions don't mention libsdl-dev. It is hard
to fighure out all the build dependencies when, as in my case, you already had
most of them installed before you began. And it is even harder to track them
across multiple linux distros. My strategy is to try to make the game good
enough that I just keep the source on github and hope that other people will
find it worthwhile to package it up for all their various distros. Not entirely
successful so far, but that's ok too.

<p>Thanks for the quick response. By the time my post was moderated (it was my first), I had figured out the SDL issue for Linux, and also have gotten it building and running on on Mac OSX. I'm getting a friend to try my steps on Mac, so when he confirms them, I'll post them here.

<p>As SDL2 was the missing dependency on Raspbian, I tried that one again, but hit some other problems. If I ever get that worked out, I'll post about my experience.

<p>Are you ever planning on restructuring the project so you don't have the bulk of the game files in one directory, or so that it builds to a separate directory?

<p>Has anyone made progress on building for Windows (or know of some obvious reason why it's not worth trying)? All your libraries seem to be cross-platform, and the big obvious hurdle I see right now is the lack of an apt-get alternative and a built-in pkg-config.

<p>Wasn't planning on it, as... well, wasn't aware of anything driving such a

So, why would I want to do that? I am not seeing what that would enable or what
problem that would avoid. Not that I'm against it, but I'm not going to do it

<p>Not a lot of progress on that front. Jeremy was for a time working on an SDL
port (moving away from gtk) but, that has stalled, I guess (to be fair, we both
got pretty demanding new jobs at the beginning of this year, so free time is a
bit scarce). Not that gtk can't be compiled for Windows (and has been done
before on my other game, Word War vi, though I don't know if gtkglext works
with Windows). From my perspective... windows has enough games, and, if people
are crying that the game doesn't work on Windows, well, shoe's on the other
foot now isn't it? How does it feel? :)


<p>It occurs to me that the joystick code uses linux-specific ioctls, so that
won't work on mac or windows -- but joysticks aren't really a big part of this
game, so that's no matter -- actually I haven't tested the joystick code in
ages. (on second look, I forgot somebody already ported the joystick code to
windows for word war vi, so it might work on windows.)

<p>To be honest, this response took me by surprise. I've been a professional
software engineer for 20 years now and I've never worked on a project set up
this way. It would be easier for people to contribute if they know what's going
on in the code, and having source files broken down into logical groups helps
with that. Also, building into the source directory makes it really hard to
package up the game for distribution, if you (or I) ever wanted to do that.
Also, building into the source directory means that a mistake in the makefile
could overwrite your source.

<p>Obviously, this is your project and you'll run it as you see fit, and all
these reasons are mostly conveniences. I'm looking forward to getting my
Artemis group to give this a try.

less the old-school way of using make.

</pre>

only 158 C source files and ~75k lines of code. So as these things go, this
project is fairly small, and relatively speaking, it's not really hard to find
anything. There is likely nothing you cannot find with a single grep (even what
little token pasting is done is augmented with comments to enable grepping).
Contrast with the asset importing library "assimp" (
http://assimp.sourceforge.net/ ) which last I checked was around 300k lines of
code, and all it does is import 3D assets (incidentally, this is why I wrote my
own asset importing code -- 2700 lines of it, roughly -- I can understand and
debug 2700 lines a hell of a lot easier than the 300k of assimp.) And, have you
ever watched someone work with a C++ codebase with visual studio? Almost
invariably, they *have no idea* where anything is defined, unless they are the
ones that wrote the bit of code they are looking at, and even then, it's iffy.
They use the IDE to navigate the code. What file any particular piece of code
is in does not matter for purposes of making the code easier to understand, and
this only gets more true as the codebase grows (e.g. if your code base is
multiple millions of LOC, you better have good tools, because you're not going
to learn your way fluently around it any time soon.) Now, I don't use visual
studio. I use vim and gcc and make. The more files there are, the more files
there are to search through. There are a few reasons to break things up into
separate files. That a file is merely large is not one of those reasons.
Breaking a large file up into smaller ones only *for the sake of making the
files smaller* makes things *harder* to find, not easier. The two largest C
files in SNIS are snis_client.c and snis_server.c and they are both roughly 13k
lines each -- not really all that big. The next biggest file is 3k lines.

And I have and do separate functionality out into separate files to form
modules -- and if you take the time to look, you'll see that I am fairly
diligent about defining reasonable interfaces and not polluting the global
namespace unnecessarily and things like that. Is it perfect? No. But it doesn't
need to be perfect. But in any case, you are talking about moving things around
into different directories, rather than busting up files, and more
specifically, you're talking about separating the build artifacts from the
source files specifically by means of directories (they are already separated
by naming conventions, mostly.)

<blockquote>
    Also, building into the source directory makes it really hard to package up the game for distribution, if you (or I) ever wanted to do that. 
</blockquote>

<p>With that, I concede you may have a point. This has nothing to do with how
hard or easy the code is to understand though. And as a counterpoint, there is
already some packaging of snis going on around the net,
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/snis-git/ and moving things around would
presumably break them (though possibly make it easier for them in the long
run.)

<blockquote>
    Also, building into the source directory means that a mistake in the makefile could overwrite your source.
</blockquote>

<p>As could a mistake with the "rm" command, or any number of other shell
commands. We have git and stacked git I don't think that overwriting the source
accidentally via the specific vector of a Makefile mistake is a concern worth
worrying about. git reflog will correct most such mistakes.


<p>Moving files around may also introduce discontinuities in the git history --
"git log --follow..." is supposed to mitigate that, but, I am not super
confident that it works perfectly.

<blockquote>
Obviously, this is your project and you'll run it as you see fit, and all these reasons are mostly conveniences. I'm looking forward to getting my Artemis group to give this a try.

</blockquote>


<p>So, the point about packaging seems like it could be a legitimate one, but
there are tons of other bits of software out there that build in a similar
manner (the typical "./configure", "make", "make install" steps) that don't
seem to have any trouble getting packaged up despite dropping build artifacts
right next to source files.


<p>And, while making a game is a goal for me, it is really a secondary goal --
the primary goal of this thing is for me to have a project to have fun
tinkering with. Moving files around to different directories, potentially
making the git history ugly... it's a little hard for me to get very excited
about it.

make it pronounceable and short, but ultimately the names were not very
satisfying. So I've tried to make them a little more "sci-fi", while keeping a

And here's the source, which includes the dictionary (although there's no license): http://fantasynamegenerators.com/scripts/spaceshipNames.js 

It's a simpler generator, as it only uses a single dictionary with an optional prefix acronym like "SS". It's made by the guy who's making Spryke

Because getting a few friends together into a room with a bunch of linux
systems wasn't quite hard enough, I have been experimenting with adding "warp
gates" into Space Nerds In Space. Normally, there's a single server process
which simulates the universe, and a number of client processes through which
players interact with that server process. Well, I say the server simulates
"the universe", but really, there's one big star in the center, a few planets,
and a bunch of asteroids, along with a big fake starry sky as a back drop. It
feels a little small, more like a solar system. So I thought, hey, it'd be kind
of cool if you could run multiple server processes, each running their own
"solar system", and have a way to travel from one to the other. That's what
warp gates do. I've got a proof of concept running, although some critical
pieces are still missing (e.g. when you travel from one system to another, you
actually jump into a new ship that's local to that system, and so far none of
the state of your old ship transfers to the new ship, and, what's more, if you
jump back to the old universe, you end up in your old ship, which continued on
it's journey without you when you first jumped out of the universe. So still
quite a lot of work to do to get all that straightened out, but nothing
insurmountable, I don't think.)

<p>Spent all day today working on procedural clouds of a sort. Clouds have been
in the back of my mind for quite some time, and I've been thinking of various
ways to approach the problem. This morning I had a bit of an epiphany. I
realized that my "earthlike" program, which sort of dynamically creates
heightmap "brushes" on the fly by sampling real terrain elevation data and
which it then paints onto a sphere, could also be used for clouds. Instead of
sampling terrain elevation data, it could sample (slightly processed) satellite
cloud imagery, treat it as if it were elevation data, and paint it onto a
sphere in exactly the same way. This could produce a 6 seamless cubemap images
of cloud texture. I could also modify gaseous-giganticus to take a cubemap
image set as input and use that for initial particle coloration. So I could
feed my cloud cubemap through gaseous-giganticus and see if I could get some
neat fluid-flow going to make some weather systems or something. So that's what
I've been up to all day. And it worked ok. Not quite as well as I was hoping it
would, but ok.


<p>Some images:
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/z7OyVqZ.jpg">
<p>The above image is "earthlike" sampling from some cloud images without any fluid flow from gaseous giganticus.

<p>I was looking at some images of Jupiter, and one thing that I've noticed is
that it's got these "spots" for lack of a better word -- these circular
whirlpools. My procedurally generated gas giants do not have these circular
whirlpools, though they do occasionally have a bit of rotation going on. So I
have tried to modify gaseous-giganticus to allow putting some whirlpools in by
adding some code to manipulate the velocity field. The direction of rotation
isn't always "correct" -- which is to say, comporting with the already present
rotation of the unmolested velocity field. I can probably fix that though.
Nevertheless, the experiments so far are not entirely failures. Here's one:

<p>As I have been working on making better assets for Space Nerds In Space, I
have resisted the urge to update the assets in the main repository because I
don't want to create a lot of churn as I keep dinking around with things. Also,
at some point, the art assets should probably be separated from the code. I've
also been thinking about how to distribute those assets. I don't have a very
good answer for that yet. Nevertheless I have created a new repo just for
assets. https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerd ... ace-assets

<p>With a recent commit, I have at least separated out the assets that define a
"solar system" to some extent. These assets are 1) planet cubemap textures, 2)
central "star" texture, and 3) skybox cubemap textures. I have created a simple
specification for such a combination of textures which now lives in
share/snis/solarsystems/xxx/assets.txt where "xxx" is the name of the solar
system in question. By default, there is a "default" solar system, which is the
same one that's been in the main space-nerds-in-space repository since the
beginning. I've created a new solarsystem, "tau-scorpii", which is in the new
repository, space-nerds-in-space-assets. Copying the tau-scorpii directory into
share/snis/solarsystems on all your SNIS clients and setting
SNIS_SOLARSYSTEM=tau-scorpii before invoking quickstart (or using the
--solarsystem option of snis_client) will make it use the new solar system.

<p>Nice work there on the clouds. I found good looking clouds quite difficult
to create also. Real weather systems are a tricky mix of bands, swirls and
flocks of satellite clouds.

<p>Lately there are some images going around about "real" exoplanets. Like the
ones in this article:

<p>I wonder how they were made. The article says "artistic impression", so I
guess they have little to do with the real exoplanets looks, but on the other
hand, they look as if they were made with specific planet features in mind
(color, bands, surface type, amount of fluid/rocky parts on the surface)

<p>It is indeed a bug, probably not in the shader, but in the engine. I have

Atmosphere rendering seems to cause some problems with depth sorting. By

a menu which will allow you to turn off atmosphere rendering, and then the
problems with depth sorting seem to disappear.

<p>Good question. I have not used a joystick very much with this game at all,
and for what little time I have spent using a joystick, it has been an xbox 360
controller. This also means the code has not been polished with joystick use in
mind, so I expect using a joystick on the weapons station will not be as good
an experience as it should be.


<p>For a time in 2014, I was designing for my own use a series of "consoles" --
boxes with loads of switches, buttons, lights, knobs, faders, joysticks, etc, a
unique one for each station, with a usb connection. There is some basic support
for custom input devices in the code, and I got as far as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6vwbhHMmI4">rigging up a toggle
switch to an arduino to trigger torpedoes to fire</a>. The plan I had was to run a
bridge sim with these consoles at ComicPalooza in Houston as part of the booth
for the hackerspace I was a member of at the time. As part of that plan, there
is a half-completed design for a 3D printable joystick I was trying to make
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/stick-of-great-enjoyment">here</a>.
But then I got a new job and moved to California, so that was the end of
that.

<p>Having said that, I can't help but be attracted to the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/flying-in-style-with-thrustmasters-450-warthog-joystick/1/">HOTAS Warthog</a>, just

<p><b>smcameron 21 Dec 2015, 02:30</b>
<p>That is because there is no height map or normal map affecting the lighting.
The texture colors are generated (baked in) from a height map, and the craters
are splatted into the height map prior to generating the colors.

<p>My program does generate corresponding height maps and normal maps, but my
engine doesn't know how to use them. Feel free to send me a patch.

Certainly using a normal map in the lighting calculations won't get you the
kind of long shadows you see if you look up images of "lunar terminator", like
this image from NASA:
<p><img src="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/hires/a12_h_50_7438.gif">
<p>which, that would be cool, but to do that I think I'd need to do shadow
mapping, and... I so far haven't even managed to do normal mapping, so this
seems unlikely.

<p>I think the normal mapping would definitely help to make things look more
"3D", but it would probably be easy to kind of "over do" the effect and
unwittingly produce a caricature of what it really should look like.

<p>Just looking at the normal maps I currently generate, I'm pretty sure I am
already "over doing" it a bit (but since I am not actually *using* the normal
maps yet...no big deal.) You can kind of get an idea what the lighting effects
of the normal maps would be just by looking at the normal maps used as if they
were color textures:

<p>When I had been working on the planets for Solarex, they had some hundreds
of thousands of triangles already. Still a triangle spans some dozens of miles,
so only the biggest craters could have real heights.

<p>At times I think a space flight simulation must have planets in several
detail levels, or able to add details on the fly when the player gets closer to
a planet.

<p>The point when my concept failed was the low orbit, from when the surface
should become a real surface and not just an spherical image, because
descending further you'll soon fly over plains, and in between mountains. It's
not possible to keep the whole planet in memory on that level of detail, so
there must be a transition from sphere to sphere segment (and if the player
flies onward, a concept to attach new sphere segments seamlesslyy to the one
already generated). This was beyond my skills.

<p>SNIS still has superior planets compared to mine, and the craters make them
even better. Good work there!
<hr>
<p><b>andrewj 25 Dec 2015, 13:42</b>
<p>I can see on the normal map image what feels missing to me: it is basically
because there is just a rim, the whole middle of the crator (inside the rim)
seems completely flat.

<p>I would expect the inside of the crater to be more like the shape of a wok.

<p>If that is a caricature and totally unrealistic, for me that doesn't matter
if the results looks good.
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 25 Dec 2015, 19:21</b>
<p>The craters are certainly still a work in progress. That being said, about the flat interiors of the craters I will say a few things.

<p>1) It seems to be in line with photos of lunar craters, esp. the large ones:
<a
href="http://www.madpc.co.uk/~peterl/Moon/Craters/Apennines.html">http://www.madpc.co.uk/~peterl/Moon/Craters/Apennines.html</a>
I expect this is because the larger impacts essentially liquefy at the point of
impact, and so level out (but I am no lunar geologist, so that may not be
correct.)

<p>2) What you think "looks good" may be largely down to what you're expecting
to see. I've spent quite a lot of time lately looking at lunar craters, so that
flat interiors of the craters don't seem too out of place to me, at least in
the case of the larger craters.

<p>3) The craters actually do slam a bowl shaped depression into the height
map. However, the height map is of limited precision (1 bytte in the current
implementation) and if the terrain is already close to zero (likely) then it
can and often does "bottom out" ate zero, producing the flatness that you
noticed. Fixing that is probably a matter of tuning the algorithm a bit to get
a height map that's not naturally so close to zero.

<p>The main complaints I have so far with the craters are:

<p>1) the height map perturbations are tloo large scale compared to the terrain
generation height map perturbations, resulting in clipping and or overflow at 0
and at 255.

<p>2) Not nearly enough small craters.

<p>3) The colors are determined by altitude and by position in a 3d noise field
to offset into a color map. Sometimes this works well, giving the "rays" a
contrasting color, but sometimes it doesn't work well. It might be neat if the
craters actually did some kind of "color displacement". Then again what I've
got now might be good enough, esp. if I can get the normal maps working.

<p>4) Probably should only have "rays" on the larger craters, not on every crater.

<p>So yeah, I am not totally happy with the craters, but neither am I totally unhappy with them.

<p>Been a while since I made an update video. This one shows progress on the
multi-server and warp gate system that I first mentioned back in August of last
year. I am still working on it, and while I have made a lot of progress, it's a
pretty big job and I've got about 30 uncommitted patches in my current stack,
and still a ways to go. But it does now reload per-solarsystem textures on
transiting between solarsystems and that is (mostly) working now, which means
that you can quite easily *tell* when you travelled from one solarsystem to
another since the planets and skybox, etc. now look different. It is still (and
perhaps will always be) a requirement that the client have the necessary
textures resident locally, but that is a detail. And the video shows off a bit
of the fruits of the most recent adventures in normal mapping that have
monopolized this thread for the last month or so. Without further ado:

    Julius:

</blockquote>



<p>Not really, no. To do that, the game would become a first person shooter,
essentially, and I'd need an interior model of the space ship that you could
wander around, etc. This seems like a huge amount of work, and all the UI's
I've done so far would have to be... rendered to textures and pasted into
virtual monitors inside the bridge interiror, or something along those lines
(and probably redesigned and simplified to enable operating them via VR), and
it would just be a radical overhaul of the game that even if I wanted to do,
I'm not sure I'd want to bite off such a large piece of work. And all that is
ignoring any porting issues of taking a C program and getting it running on
Android, which I really don't know too much about. If I were to try to go for a
VR route, I think I'd stick to dedicated systems built specifically for it,
like the Rift (which was at one time going to support linux but I think they
may have dropped that feature -- haven't been paying attention.) I think
turning the game into a a VR FPS kind of takes away a bit from the
collaborative in-person experience of the game, which probably isn't a good
thing, since that is the main differentiating thing about the game.

<p>One could argue that having a voice activated computer that can do
everything on the ship might also take away from that experience -- what are
the players needed for if the captain can just say, "computer do this, do
that", and the thing drives itself?) But, such a computer is star trek canon,
and kind of ridiculously cool that it's actually possible to attempt to create
such a thing, and not even very difficult, so... it gets a pass. And well, the
computer cannot fire or aim the guns, and while it's a neat novelty, it doesn't
actually work so well that it's super convenient, and it can be ignored easily
if it detracts from the multiplayer in-person experience.

<p>There is a non-free game called "Pulsar: Lost Colony" that you can look up
which is a multi-player bridge sim that is done as a first person shooter style
where you wander around a virtual bridge that has virtual terminals for
stations, etc, and I know at one time they were talking about supporting
occulus rift, and even had some prototype going, but I do not know if that is
still on their full feature list. It wouldn't surprise me if they cut it or put
it on the back burner just due to lack of people able to take advantage of it
and uncertainty about the hardware or for other reasons (eg. performance
requirements). Here's a video of their prototype:

<p><b>Julius » 11 Apr 2016, 12:28</b>
<p>I don't really think you need a full walkable 3D bridge, as you basically
never move from the chair/station. What can be done very easily with the
Cardboard SDK is a stereoscopic 360° rendered picture/looping video in which
you can freely look around and interact with predefined points.

<p>The jmonkey3D engine also has a more or less ready made support for
Cardboard/Occulus etc. if that fits the bill better.

<p>While I agree that this game shines with in-person multiplayer, simple VR
support would be probably the next best thing for playing it over the internet
and communicating with your friends via voice chat.

<p>P.S.: To my own surprise the Google Cardboard works actually much better than expected (if you have the right phone/headset combination).

<p>More minor improvements in the voice recognition -- not sure it's apparent
what differences there are from the last video posted. I figured out a little
more about how pocketsphinx works, and now it understands more commands, and
more different ways of doing the same command, but it is incremental progress,
really.

<p>Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N0ILFW_ft0&feature=youtu.be">the end of August of 2015</a>
I had made a proof of concept of traveling
between multiple "universes" (really, more like solar systems) within the game.
Over the last 8 months or so I have been slowly trying to get this code stable
and working, and doing all the things it needs to be able to do (mostly having
to do with maintaining state of the player ship) to be something worth
committing. There turned out to be quite a lot of code for this, around 75
patches. I didn't clean them up quite to the level of my usual standards, but
carrying around ~70 patches for ~8 months was getting to be a little tiresome
(although <a href="http://procode.org/stgit/">stgit</a> made it tolerable). This new code is still disgustingly hacky
in the way that it works, but it is nonetheless committed, and you can try
playing with it.

<p>There is now a new process, snis_multiverse, which maintains the state of all
bridges in a small "database". This means that when you run snis_client (either
manually, or via the quickstart script) there is now a "create ship" checkbox.
The first time you use a ship name, you need to check this box, and subsequent
times, you should leave it unchecked -- that is to say, your ship is now
persistent between runs, and its state is preserved in the "database"
maintained by snis_multiverse.

<p>I am quite sure there are a lot of bugs lurking in this new code -- some I
already know about, and undoubtedly some that I don't know about. I expect
there are some races in the hand-over code when all the snis_clients on a
bridge switch to a new snis_server, and I expect there is still some ship state
that is not preserved across such switches, but at least the infrastructure to
preserve that state exists now.

<p>By default, the quickstart script will only start a single instance of
snis_server, and there will not be any warp gates in the game. But, if you
"export MULTIVERSE_TEST=1" prior to running quickstart, it will create 3
instances of snis_server -- that is to say, 3 solar systems -- and will put
warp gates near each planet, and you can buy warp gate tickets to different
solar systems from the starbases via the comms station. You are advised to use
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space-assets">additional art assets in the space-nerds-in-space-assets repository on github</a>
if you run multiple solar systems.

<p>When running in multiverse mode, every planet currently has a nearby warp gate,
and from any warp gate, you can get to every other known solar system. The warp
gates correspond 1 to 1 between every pair of solarsystems, so if you depart
from warp gate X in solarsystem A to solarsystem B, you will consistently pop
out of the same warp gate in solarsystem B, and if you depart from warp gate
X+1 in solarsystem A, you will pop out at warp gate N+1 in solarsystem B. In
the future, I think I would like to be able to have some kind of graph to
establish the possible paths of travel between warp gates to enable building a
more interesting topology of solar systems than this kind of automatic and
fully connected graph we have now.

<p><a href="http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=3710&start=25">About three years ago</a>
I implemented the damage control station with a little
robot that you can drive around to repair your ship, and this is tied into the
engineering station and power model for all the various systems of the ship. At
the time, there was a bit of discussion about whether or not this thing was
actually a good idea, or maybe not such a great idea.


<p>I have now made the damage control station "optional." It's optional in the
sense that now the "automatic" mode for the robot actually works, and if you
turn it on, then the robot can drive itself around and autonomously repair your
ship for you without any intervention. There is some intelligence to how it
chooses what to repair at any given time -- if shields or warp drive are esp.
damaged, it will fix those first, as they tend to be more critical for
survival, and otherwise choose to fix approximately the closest and most
damaged component. There is doubtless room for improvement, better
prioritization of which systems to repair first, and taking into account the
overall damage to a system, not just the damage to individual components, etc.
If you manually control the robot, you can likely do a quicker job, and make
wiser decisions about what to repair next. But if you're short a player, the
robot doesn't strictly require a human operator any more.


<p>I don't have a video for this update -- it's not all that interesting to watch.
From the programming side, the most interesting thing is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* pathfinding
algorithm</a> which is used to let the robot navigate around the deck where all the
systems reside -- not that the A* algorithm is anything new, but I think the
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/a_star.h">API I came up with</a>
is quite nice, although the implementation is nothing
special, and on a large graph, performance is suboptimal just because I didn't
bother to optimize since the graph I am searching is small (~50-100 nodes).
It's nice because the caller is not required to represent the search space in
any particular way, so long as a list of neighbor nodes may be obtained from a
given node, and so long as a cost estimate and distance estimate function can
be constructed to estimate the distance/cost between two given nodes. An
example of how to use the API is in <a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/a_star_test.c">a_star_test.c</a>.

<p>The following additions have been made in the last few days:

<p>You can now set asteroid speeds (between 0 and 1). This is primarily to allow stationary asteroids.
<p>You can now control the ratios of the ingredients contained within asteroids.
<pre>
	set_asteroid_speed(id, speed);
</pre>
Sets the speed of the asteroid with the specified id to the specified
value. The speed should be between 0 and 1.
<pre>
    set_asteroid_minerals(id, carbon, silicates, nickeliron, preciousmetals);
</pre>

-- sets the proportions
of carbon, silicates, nickeliron, preciousmetals. Returns 0.0 on success, nil otherwise.
May fail if id doesn't match an asteroid.

<p>Example:
<pre>
            asteroid = add_asteroid(1000.0, 1000.0, 10000.0);
            set_asteroid_speed(asteroid, 0.0);
            set_asteroid_minerals(asteroid, 90.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0);
</pre>

<p>You can now get a callback based on proximity of two objects to one another.
So you can have your mission script react when the player ventures too close to
the space-thingy in your mission scripts.
<pre>
    register_proximity_callback(callback, oid1, oid2, distance);
</pre>

-- when the objects
indicated by oid1 and oid2 are within the specified distance of one another,
the specified callback is called passing the two object ids.

<p>Example:
<pre>
            function mycallback(oid1, oid2, distance)
                    print "Player has come within 300 of starbase_x\n";
            end
            register_proximity_callback("mycallback", player_ids[1], starbase_x, 300);
</pre>

<p>Timed text windows for mission start explanations, win screens, lose screens, etc. are now supported.
<pre>
    show_timed_text(id, time_in_seconds, textstring);
</pre>

<p>shows a text screen with the given textstring for the specified amount of time
on all clients of the bridge for the given player ship id. If id is -1, then
the message is displayed on all clients of all bridges.

<p>Lua scripts can now be chained with one script starting another when it
ends. The specified script is added to a queue, and when the current script
ends, the next one on the queue begins.
<pre>
    enqueue_lua_script(scriptname);
</pre>
Queue the named lua script for execution;

<p>Many ship attributes may now be queried:

{l Code}: {l Select All Code}
<pre>
    get_ship_attribute(id, attribute_name); 
</pre>

-- returns the specified attribute of the ship. The
type depends on the attribute, though generally will be a number or a string.

<p>The attributes and their types are listed below (output of print_ship_attributes program):
The types are as follows (from key_value_parser.h):
<pre>
       's' - string
       'q' - number (uint64_t)
       'w' - number (uint32_t)
       'h' - number (uint16_t)
       'b' - number (uint8_t)
       'Q' - number (int64_t)
       'W' - number (int32_t)
       'H' - number (int16_t)
       'B' - number (int8_t)
       'd' - number (double)
       'f' - number (float)
</pre>
Though, to lua, they're all just "numbers."

<p>The attributes are as follows:
<pre>
                                     Key Type     offset       size      index

<p>Some improvements to planetary rings. I spent some time watching videos of
the Cassini flyby of Saturn. In particular this one: 
<a href="https://vimeo.com/33933151">
https://vimeo.com/33933151</a>

<p>This made me realize a few of things. 1) the rings are essentially either
opaque or transparent -- there's not a lot of translucency. 2) The side of the
rings in sunlight looks different than the opposite side, which is in shade.
So, I made a few changes to try to get things to look a bit more realistic.
Shadows tend to be stark, not subtle.

<p>Here are three views of the same planet with my changes The rings have a
light side and a dark side now.

<p>Here's a video that demonstrates some new functionality of the Lua API of
Space Nerds in Space. In particular, it demos the show_timed_text() and
text_to_speech() functions. This is a demo of the training-mission-1.lua
script, which implements a timed race in which the player has to dock at four
starbases in succession, finally returning to the first starbase to dock and
complete the race. It took me about 10 minutes to complete the circuit in this
run.

<p>I have added a new mission script, SPACEPOX.LUA

<p>SPACE POX

<p>Locate and deliver SPACE POX VACCINE to save the crew
of the ICARUS station orbiting planet BONX from the
SPACE POX which has broken out and is slowly killing
them off one by one in a series of unlikely "accidents"

<p>This mission can be kind of difficult
The biggest difficulty is finding the space pox vaccine
unless you know the trick. Then, the zarkon dreadknights
are liable to get you unless you make a quick getaway, but
your warp drive will probably not help you.

<p>Here is the script: <a
href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/luascripts/SPACEPOX.LUA">SPACEPOX.LUA</a>
(contains spoilers, obviously).

more difficult than I expected to come up with decent scenarios and implement
them.

<p>Here is some GPL'ed 3D turret aiming code someone may find useful. It does
rely on some other code (for quaternions and vectors mostly). I figured I'd
post this here since I thought other game developers might find it useful, as
getting this to work is a bit tricky. The turret may be arbitrarily oriented,
it is not required that the turret axes be aligned with any world axes, for
example. The turret is rate limited in its motion about its axes (you set the
limits.) It currently does not have enforced limits on motion about those axes
though -- the turret can pass the guns through its own base, for example. It's
on my list of things to do, but it's not done.

<p>This is, by far, the most amazing game ever! I played Artemis with our crew for
a while, that was super fun, but this is a whole new level of awesome.  The
whole "real time" effect is the best, It's like being in a real life version of
Firefly or USS Defiant. Start up the game, pull up a seat, open a beer and
hangout, until you're required to do some work. Being a member of this crew, in
this space, is like having the best job in the verse.

<p>I'm on comms and have figured out:
<p>request to dock
<p>request a towing service
<p>buy / sell mined stuff to get money

<p>-- I still haven't figured out how to re-fuel the ship, any advice here would be great... please... seriously... I really need help..
<p>otherwise our games will continue to end, with the ships voice telling us the fuel level is critical. I figure it's probably going to involve "/computer do X " or "/hail SB-01 request refuel" ??

<p>Please keep making this great game :)

<p>There are two ways to get out of the "Fuel levels critical" situation, one of which is cheating.

<p>The first way is to hail a starbase, and select option 4, "REQUEST TOWING
SERVICE". A tow ship will be dispatched to your location and tow you to the
starbase which you contacted. If you have near zero fuel, it will give you a
little bit of fuel too, so you can drive to the starbase and dock. Once you
dock with the starbase, you will be refueled. It is possible the tow ship might
get killed en route to your location, in which case it won't show up (you can
call for another one.) It's also possible for the tow ship to be attacked while
towing you, in which case it may drop you where ever you might be (middle of
nowhere) and run away. Again, you can call another tow truck in that case.

<p>To successfully dock with the starbase (after the tow truck drops you off near it) you need to:

<p>1: make sure docking magnets are engaged (there's a button on the navigation screen)
<p>2: make sure you lower your shields (it will tell you to lower your shields if you forget)
<p>3: request permission to dock while shields are down and when you're pretty close to the starbase (within 5000 units, I think. It will tell you if you're too far.)
<p>4: Navigate to a docking port on the station after permission is granted but before permission expires (you can ask permission again, of course.)

<p>The docking ports vary in appearance, but you can guess which parts of the station they are, some look like this:

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JO7gGy1.jpg">
<p>or like this:
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9jTwvFw.jpg">
<p>Once you dock with the port (by ramming it, basically), you will be
connected to it. Your ship will be refueled and repaired, and all the systems
will be turned off. To undock, turn off the docking magnets (navigation screen)
and power on your systems (engineering screen).


<p>The second (cheating) way to get more fuel is as follows. Once it starts
saying "Fuel levels Critical!", go to the DEMON screen, and type in "safemode".
The next time it says "Fuel levels Critical!", you will get your tank filled.
"safemode" also has some side effects, it prevents enemies from deciding to
attack you (if they already decided though, they don't quit.) If you type
"safemode" a second time, it toggles off (you won't lose your fuel, but enemies
might decide to attack). Safemode is a toggle. However there's no indicator of
whether it's enabled or not (I should fix it, but I only put it in to help with
debugging anyway.)

<p>A couple new features added recently:

<p>1. You can now set up to 10 waypoints on the Science station, either by
typing in X, Y, Z coordinates directly, or by marking the ship's current
position. The waypoints are selectable from the list of waypoints, or via the
short range scanner or via the long range scanner. Once selected, the green
arrow on the Navigation screen will point to the waypoint (just as it points
towards anything that Science has selected.)

<p>2. Life support system. There's a new system on the damage control screen,
life support. There are also power and coolant sliders on the Engineering
screen for life support, and a gauge for oxygen, which is produced by the life
support system (from e.g. electrolysis of water). If the life support system is
damaged (or deprived of power), it will produce less oxygen. Oxygen is consumed
at a fixed rate. If the rate of oxygen production is below the rate of
consumption, the oxygen levels will slowly decrease. If they get too low, the
crew will asphyxiate.

<p>Some minor progress on Space Nerds In Space. Improved UI sound effects (I
think), most buttons make some kind of sound now. Added tooltips to all buttons
and sliders. Now you can eject the warp core. I need to work on the warp core
ejecting mechanic to make it a bit more meaningful, but the basics are there.

<p>Been thinking about Comms, and how comms always seems to be lacking
something very meaningful to do in these bridge simulator type games, so I am
revisiting an idea I had about 3 years ago but never really pursued: Add a Real
Time Strategy game into Space Nerds In Space, and let Comms be the one to
direct the action. Here's a little demo of what I have working so far:

<p>Don't know if anyone will find this interesting, but I decided to try a
little live stream coding session. Mostly it's 30 minutes of me being slightly
puzzled. OTH, I found that "obs studio" is actually capable of doing a decent
job capturing video, unlike anything else I've tried so far that didn't involve
extra hardware.

<p>So I've got the basics working with this HOTAS joystick setup today-- not
counting the rudder pedals -- my cheapo "open box special" turned out to be
missing a RJ12 to USB adapter that's apparently needed for the rudder pedals.
D'oh! (I suspect someone broke or lost their adapter, went to Fry's and bought
this thing, extracted the adapter, then returned it, sans adapter, and then I
bought it as an "open box special.")


<p>There is now a joystick config file (example default config here: 
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/joystick_config.txt">https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/joystick_config.txt</a>)

<p>Have to say, it's pretty cool!

<p>I still need to add more "functions" that are hookable to the joysticks
(e.g. Currently it's not possible to connect "Reverse", "Engage warp", "toggle
docking magnets", and other misc. things to the various joystick buttons, but
there's no reason it couldn't be, and this sort of thing I will get to in the
next few days.)

<p>In case anyone plays around with this (ha!) and adds some config for their
particular joystick, I am trying to collect such configurations, and have an
issue to do so here:

<p>So, while watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5c4c5cIik4">a
review</a> of this HOTAS joystick/throttle/rudder pedals combo, I realized that
the missing RJ12 to USB adapter is actually not a problem after all because the
throttle has an RJ12 socket into which you can plug the rudder pedals, and I
tried it out, and it seems to work, with the rudder pedals showing up as an
additional 3 axes on the throttle device.

Also, I've committed changes to allow mapping almost everything on the
Navigation screen to joystick buttons and axes.

<p>Pretty nice... although they would seem a bit out of place on a bridge
simulator (as opposed to a dog-fighting space shooter).

<p>Any other plans for input devices? Separate Android touch-screen? Steam controller?
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 10 Nov 2017, 16:49</b>
<p>I don't think it's really out of place for the Nav console, but supposing
not everyone agrees with that, it's easy enough to not buy something like this
and not plug it in. In any case, someone specifically asked for this
capability, and it's easy enough, so I didn't see a reason not to do it.

<p>As for other input devices, no plans for phones, the steam controller should
be very easy as I presume it shows up as just another input device, so it
should just be a matter of seeing what it shows up as in /dev/input/by-id and
adding some entries into the joystick config file. But, kind of hard to do that
when I do not own a steam controller. Feel free to send patches. Github issue
to collect joystick configs here:
