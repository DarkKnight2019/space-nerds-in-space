<p>Hi guys... I've got a new project rolling these days...

<p>https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space

<p>Still in the pretty early days, not even "playable" yet, really, though I expect to approach "playable" tomorrow or in the next few days (though no where near polished enough to be considered done.)

<p>So this game (when it becomes a game) is very much inspired by Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator
See: http://www.artemis.eochu.com/ The idea is you have a game which is played much as the actors in the Star Trek TV series played their roles on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. There are a number of "stations": Navigation, Weapons, Science, Communications, etc. and each player assumes that role. Each station has it's own laptop or other computer which communicates via network to a central server which simulates the game universe. So it's kind of a cooperative multiplayer network game... No reason not to have multiple teams in multiple starships inhabiting the same server/universe either cooperating or doing battle.

<p>Mine is different than Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator in that it is:

<ul>
<li>GPL'ed.
<li>Linux/gtk
<li>Probably uglier (lol).
<li>Probably more scalable (yay vector graphics.)
<li>Not even close to finished.
</ul>

<p>Here's a video from a couple days ago... (much progress since then.)
<p>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF19sPZGvmo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF19sPZGvmo</a> (yeah... it's not much to look at yet.)

<p>Hoping to be able to "drive" the ship around the "universe" and "shoot stuff" sometime tomorrow... we'll see.

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I'm not sure what you're asking...

<p>It's going to be real time, but the action is probably somewhat slow, not frenzied. In some ways it's a simulation, but, also an action game?

<p>In any case, I've gotten pretty far in the last day.

<p>You can now drive and shoot, which as everyone knows, are the two most important activities of a starship captain.

<p>Individual players can join the game at any time, and specify which starship to join, and multiple starships per game are possible. (this is all working now.)

<p>That being said, you can pretty much *only* drive and shoot -- and the torpedoes don't ever hit anything, or die -- the torpedoes are immortal, just like everything else in the game so far (deleting objects from all the clients is not straightforward, but should be do-able, just haven't done it...)

<b>Skorpio 04 Nov 2012, 20:51</b>
<p>With simulation I meant a more complex game in comparison to a simplistic action game, but of course a simulation can be simple as well and contain lots of action (like the farming simulator :D ).

<p>Got a lot done over the last week, as I was on vacation for Thanksgiving. Too lazy to do a video today, so just some screen shots:
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZGfxh.png">
<p>Above is all the client modes (screens) Weapons, Navigation, Science, Comms,
Engineering, and Debug. They are small because, like Word War vi, the graphics
scale to match the window size, and I have shrunk them all down to fit on the
screen. They are all separate processes communicating via network with a server
process. The large screen partially shown on the right is the "main" screen.
Any client process can "project" his screen onto the "main" screen by pressing
"ctrl-O" -- O for "on screen!", as Capt. Picard so frequently says.  
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0n0yU.png">
<p>Above is the navigation screen. Left/right arrow keys rotate the ship,
up/down arrow keys move the ship fore and aft. The Warp drive slider and
"engage" button "warp" the ship instantly through space (the warp drive needs
some work to make it a little more intuitave and, uh, dramatic as well.)
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GZNuo.png">
<p>Above is the Weapons screen. Torpedoes may be loaded into the torpedo tubes
(2) and fired at passing ships. This needs work (sound effects) and also, right
now, a single hit invariable annihilates whatever it hits, so that needs
fixing. Phasers don't work yet.
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NMUx1.png">
<p>Above is the "science" screen (scanning). You have a scanning beam that you
can swing around using left/right arrow keys. up/down arrow keys control the
width of the beam. When the beam is wide, it's range is short, and the further
away things are, they "fuzzier" they are. As you narrow the beam, the objects
become less fuzzy. At a certain point, when things are un-fuzzed enough, you
get some information about the ship, like it's name, position, bearing, range,
heading, shield strength and wavelength characteristics. You can also zoom the
science scope in and out using the mouse scroll wheel.

<p>The "dotted" lines in the above still picture are kind of moving around and
a bit more lively than they look in this picture, but you can't see it in a
still shot.
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DBYiI.png">
<p>Above is the engineering screen. There are 4 gauges: RPM, Fuel, Power, and
Temperature. The idea is you have some sort of "engine" consuming "fuel" and
producing "power" which can be distributed to the various systems. The power is
a function of rpm and temperature. The sliders are used to distribute the power
around the ship. The power distribution part doesn't really do anything yet
(but the sliders work.)
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C13Up.png">
<p>Last, is the debug screen, which shows a map of the universe. The white dots
(or, X's, if you look really closely) represent computer controlled ships. They
are clustered around the "starbases" because the AI for these ships at the
moment consists of "go sit near the nearest starbase."

<p>Also, difficult to show, when you start up each client you can specify which
"roles" it will fulfill -- science, weapons, navigation, etc. ("all" is an
option.) Additionally there is a "soundserver" role, so that sounds which are
global to the ship -- e.g. being hit by a photon torpedo -- can be directed to
the system that is connected to the big stereo. Sounds also may be directed to
individual stations -- so you could get distinctive science-y beeping noises
from the science station laptop, and weapons-y noises from the weapons stations
etc. Not that any of those sounds are in there yet, but the infrastructure to
do it is there in the code.

<p>No 3d "thru the window" view yet --- if I do it, it will be a totally
software z-buffered flat-shaded triangle renderer that looks like it's from a
1982 silicon graphics workstation. You'd probably rather someone besides me
programs that bit, lol. As would I, as would I.

<p>-- steve

<p>p.s. Not getting a lot of feedback... wonder if I'm wasting my time creating
a game that requires you get together 4-6 of your linux/startrek nerd friends
on a LAN to play, lol. Well, it's a fun waste of time programming the thing,
and, I am learning a bit doing it, so... I'll keep at it. I do worry that the
various stations won't actually be *fun enough* though -- trying to program in
some "fun", but, also keeping to the spirit of the thing -- the "fun" may
depend more on the personality of the participants than on the game content for
this sort of game, not sure.

<p>3D would be great on the long term.
 <hr>
<p><b>smcameron 25 Nov 2012, 20:01</b>
<p>Well... probably if I switched from basic gtk/gdk line drawing and so on to
cairo, compositing a backdrop image -- even scalable -- would be possible,
similar to Dueling Masters of Space Time.
http://smcameron.github.com/dueling-mas ... pace-time/ Performance might be
iffy on low end machines, but, eh, it'd probably be ok. To some extent, I think
the "looks" of the thing aren't necessarily all that important, what's
important is that is should be "fun", and fun and looks are not necessarily
correlated, and maybe a lot of the "fun" of this particular game may come from
the people playing it, we'll see, I guess.

<p>The one place I think that the looks probably do matter quite a bit would be
in the as-yet-unimplemented 3d "out the window" viewscreen.

<p>I need to hurry up and get things far enough along that I can get some
people together to play it and see what it's like.

<p>I wouldn't worry too much about the looks, I didn't mean it in a critical way.

<p>This looks exciting! What self-ironic name. :) (It might make sense to make
some things in the game nerdy-funny-ironic, rather than nerdy-serious, too.
in-game warning messages perhaps.)

<p>The look is quite TTY-retro but dark-blue-on-black is very bad to read. I recommend light blue instead for the weapons screen.

<p><b>Skorpio 26 Nov 2012, 20:25</b>
<p>I've been working on some new top-down spaceships (and mechs), just for fun,
and wondered if you have a use for them. Or are you going for a more abstract
look and 3D graphics for the screen? If you want 3D ships, then you could
probably utilize the shipyard on OGA.

<p>Btw, I think the term phaser is protected and you should better replace it.

<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 26 Nov 2012, 22:29</b>

<p>I'm probably going for a more abstract thing than those top-down views. The
shpyard may come in handy when I get to the 3d stuff. (I have vague notions of
metaprogramming OpenSCAD to procedurally generate spaceship models, but haven't
thought very hard about it.)

<p>As far as "phasers" being a protected term... I'm a little skeptical. Games
like Netrek (<a href="http://www.netrek.org/">http://www.netrek.org/</a> )
contain "phasers" ( <a href="http://www.netrek.org/beginner/newbie.php">http://www.netrek.org/beginner/newbie.php</a>)
, as do all the old text based star trek games. If a lawyer writes me a scary
letter, I'll worry about it then.

<p>For now, getting the game into a playable state (and I think the 3d view is
not strictly needed for that) is the highest priority.

<blockquote>

<p>Well, as a start, various ships will attack various starbases, as well as
your ship, so you try to intervene, etc. and stay alive.

<p>Additionally, multiple player-controlled starships may inhabit a server, so
either cooperative or combative play is possible. "Space" being kind of wide
open (and in my implemenation) kind of two dimensional, there's not much
opportunity to hide-n-seek, or have elaborate strategies that I can think of
for multi-ship combat. Will have to think about some ways to liven that up and
make things more interesting.

<p>Farther than that, I haven't really given it much thought, just trying to
get the game to a playable state for now.

<p>If you have some particular ideas, feel free to share, but of course I can't
guarantee I'll ever get around to implementing any of them.

<p>Ideas that allow simple things to be combined in interesting ways that lead
to some interesting emergent behavior are probably the best, but that is kind
of a tall order.

(FDesktopRecorder is the one I find the best for Linux). Also, if you find

<p>+1 for openscad. I'm aware of brlcad and it's history for a some time btw.
<p>But for programmers openscad seems like an awesome tool - again because I'm a fan of parametric and procedural design.
<p>On the other hand maybe I've missed similar features in brlcad?
<p>Can it do CSG operations like intersection, subtraction and addition on 3D geometry and that parametrically scripted with macro/modules

<p>Would be nice if you can surprise me.

<p>Edit: The MGED Quick Reference card shows a brlcad programming example with variables, loops and conditions.
But openscad seems 'turing' complete, looks familiar and decomposition into modules (like C functions) is simple and obvious, too.

<blockquote>

<p>I'm a big fan of openSCAD as well. I'm not actually sure whether it's turing
complete or not. It does have some pretty severe limitations (e.g. the
"variables" you get in openSCAD act more like constants than like variables.)
For this reason, I came up with openCSCAD, which is a tiny little C library for
outputting openSCAD code. (It's kind of a neat little hack at best, and a
useless piece of crap at worst, lol.) It does technically get you nice things
like real variables, recursion etc. but at the cost of massive openscad file
output which may or may not really be processable by openscad. (e.g. the tree
picture on that page was done by screen shotting after pressing F5, not F6. F6
in openscad actually does all the reall CSG stuff, and doing all the
intersections of all those branches, etc... well, you may or may not live long
enough to see that computation run to completion.)

<p>Haven't yet looked at BRLCAD, as I have no pressing need, and it looks a bit daunting.

<hr>
<p><b>hc 12 Jan 2013, 23:12</b>

<p>Hm, assumed that recursion in OpenSCAD would work - which would still make
it a more or less complete functional programming language for solids even
without variables - but it didn't work. It gave no errors for module-recursion
but didn't work as expected, duplicating and renaming the duplicate method code
did of course. Yes, seems pretty static compile time and incomplete but for
technical/mechanical models it should be enough.  As for BRL-CAD: Can't imagine
a tank having fractal structures ... unless for stealth someday ;)

<p>Yeah, generating code from code is of course an option - besides openSCAD's code-editor isn't the best.
OpenSCAD's loops should suffice most of the time, I think I'll try when in need of recursive structures.


<p>Wouldn't mind if Admins would move this discussion about tools somewhere
else - don't want to divert from the interesting work in progres topic.

<p>Yes. I'm pretty sure the openSCAD developers know this, because they provided a
"hide editor" option, and the F3 key reloads the source file. What I do is have
vim going in another window, and switch between the two with alt-tab. Save from
vim, alt-tab to openscad, F3, then F6, then alt-tab back to vim -- that is
essentially the "edit compile debug edit" cycle for me with openscad.

Brian Rubin:

</blockquote>

<p>Ok....

<p>Inspiration, well obviously Artemis, as I've mentioned. I've never played it
myself, but I've seen youtube videos, and it seemed like a cool idea, and not
having (nor wanting) a windows machine, I figured, well, I guess I've got to
make my own version. This is a bit of a pattern for me, as another game, or
more like a novelty than a game which I made, called "Be The Wumpus" came in to
existence in the same way -- taking the kernel of an idea of an existing
Windows-only game and making my own version of it. Of course, the Star Trek TV
series also informed the design of the game to an extent -- same as it did for
Artemis, presumably.


<p>Time spent working on it... hmm, well, as the painters say, my whole life up
to this point. Well, I first began working on the network part of it, in the
form of a generic lobby server which can be found here:
https://github.com/smcameron/ssgl although that code is out of date and buggy
compared to the variant which is found within SNIS -- need to fix that, I
suppose -- about 2 years ago I guess (according to github). I got bogged down
with that when I couldn't figure out how to do NAT punchthrough for
peer-to-peer connections. So that lay fallow for a couple of years. But, the
initial impetus for the lobby server was to make a game similar to Artemis, and
that would have been in the fall of 2010, when I first became aware of Artemis.
But, I got bogged down in the NAT punchthrough, and Christmas rolled around,
and vacation, and I got distracted, and just dropped it. I think I also had
some of the network code for SNIS partially done (but buggy as hell) at that
time. But in any case, I dropped it at the end of 2010.


<p>And then, in November of 2012, there was a "hackathon" at Platform Houston (
http://www.platformhouston.com/ ) and I knew one of the guys involved in that
place, so I said sure, I'll go to this hackathon, which was a 2-day weekend
thing, see what you can cook up in two days. So I was kind of fishing around
for ideas of what to do, and I thought of this old idea of doing a variant of
Artemis, and I remembered Space Nerds in Space that I had started back in 2010,
so I thought, ok, let me pick up that ball again.


<p>So I spent a couple days of hard programming getting that onto it's feet.
So, all the infrastructure work that I did in 2010, building the lobby code,
and the network code, that, by itself, did nothing, and was quite a lot of
drudgery to write (all C code, from scratch, not much in the way of pre-made
libraries, just because, that's how I roll, usually, not for any good reason
other than sheer pigheaded stubbornness, really) -- all that work served me
pretty well, and having taken that long break, well, I got the thing to where
you could 'drive" and "shoot", and had several different "screens" all
potentially separate processes communicating via network working in those 2
days. And of course I re-used a lot of ideas and code -- esp. the font system
-- from Word War vi -- so the graphics kind of have that look -- everything is
drawn with lines, so everything is scalable. One thing that has always
irritated me is when you start up a game and it's at a fixed resolution, and
esp. old games written for low-res systems that now look tiny on modern
systems, so I tend to make my games scale. Anyway, I digress.


<p>So, over Thanksgiving I had a good solid week off work, and put that to use
on SNIS, and made a lot of good progress. Most recently, I've gotten bogged
down in the 3d graphics aspects. This is probably a mistake, in several ways.
First, I was trying to make my own software 3d renderer. It soon became clear
that 1) debugging the thing is really hard for me, 2) it's not fast enough. So
there are a couple possible solutions to that, one would be to use gtkglext to
do the graphics and well, I'd have a different set of bugs (that I would
presumably create) to worry about and lose some portability, but it should be
plenty fast, and the other possibility is just use a wireframe renderer
(already done, mostly) and don't worry about making the 3d graphics all fancy.
If it's good enough for Elite on the old BBC micro, then it's just plain good
enough, right? :) Esp. considering the game is fundamentally a 2D game, so the
3D graphics are somewhat superfluous, *except*, for that starship bridge
experience with a big projection screen, you've got to have some kind of "out
the window" view, right?


<p>As far as planned features, well, I suppose I would aim for the minumum set
of features that will make a fun game, as a start. That is, each station has
got to have enough for the players to do, and behave in ways that encourage
cooperation between "crewmembers", the crew has got to be able to get their
ship into interesting and dangerous situations and be able to get out of them
(or not) in some kind of interesting and fun way, and basically have something
to do, other than merely mindlessly driving and shooting.


<p>The game as it stands today is not ready to be reviewed or played. For
starters, there are some bugs that need fixing first, but there is quite a lot
else that needs doing.


<p>In the last few weeks, I've been distracted from SNIS, (adding shiny laser
projector support to Word War vi, and other little amusements).


<p>But, I hope to get back to SNIS development soon.

<p>Feel free to ask more questions.

will it take someone to fix a system while ignoring the rest of the interface?

<p>You may be right. We'll see. Once I had the idea, I couldn't get it out of
my head any quicker way than by implementing it. An "autonomous mode" in which
the robot performs his functions by himself is probably a good idea, if for no
other reason than it might be hard to get enough crewmembers together to play
all the stations.

<p>Yeah, I too thought this felt like an overly-repetitive chore. I would
really not want to go through this minigame more than once to fix my spaceship.

<p>You know what would be better? If you install new stuff on your ship and
manually lug them around (fixing should, preferably, be automated). It would
definitely... personalise your ship more. I envision something like Secret
Bases in Pokemon games (I know, I know...) where you can put useful things as
well as decorate the place with gratuitous plants and tables and chairs and so
on.
<hr>
<p><b>JeffM2501 21 May 2013, 17:14</b>
<p>Componentization is a good thing but I think you are pondering the wrong
aspects of it. What I think would be fun would be to build up a ship from a set
of modules that contain equipment. So you can upgrade your Warp, or beams, or
add more missile tubes.


<p>These type of games don't really let you walk around the ship to see tables
and chairs, the idea is that your physical computer screen is the console you
use as a crew member of the ship and the 3d view you see is ether out the
window, or in this case a camera above the engineering bay (that somehow
magically can follow the robot)
<hr>
<p>Part of my motivation for the whole "damcon arena" as I call it, was to
provide something for the players to say to each other.

<p>I imagine:

<p>Captain: "How's that warp drive repair coming, Scotty?"

<p>Scotty: "Fine, I just have to get the transient wormhole suppressor reinstalled and we should be good to go."

<p>And Scotty wouldn't just be merely "repeating what the computer says" (a la
galaxy quest), he would actually _mean_ that he really was trying to re-install
the transient wormhole suppressor into the warp drive in the game.

<p>Whether that's really good enough reason, and whether it's worth while... I
don't really know. I'll think about it some more.

<P>It's also arguable that I haven't succeeded in getting very far away from
having the player just "repeating what the computer says" in that the names I
came up with are obviously just pseudo-space-jargon gibberish with no actual
meaning or relevance.

<p>There's no view frustrum culling, so things which are behind the camera show
up upside down and reversed. If someone well versed in the ways of the 3D

<p>Tried to do a multiplayer run at Houston's hackerspace, TX/RX Labs today,
but ran into technical issues with the network. It seems the machine hosting
the server process would randomly get re-assigned a new IP address. Needless to
say any TCP connections established with the old IP address ceased to work. The
projector screen was also terribly washed out due to it being the daytime and
light flooding in through the skylights. Maybe next week will be more
successful.

<p>BTW, in case people want to try this game (in its current unfinished state),
but don't have enough linux-using friends, here's how you make a bootable live
dvd containing the game that can be run on windows machines without disturbing
it at all, which is what I had done for the above picture, as all those
machines are windows boxes. This does assume a 32-bit Mint 13 linux install
(you could install it in a vm to make the dvds, I guess.) This worked for me...
if it doesn't work for you, well, you're probably on your own for now.
<blockquote>
<pre>
 Install the package "mintconstructor" from the repositories
   sudo apt-get install mintconstructor

    Open a terminal
    Type sudo /usr/lib/linuxmint/mintConstructor/mintConstructor.py
    In the mintconstructor window that opens:
   In the "Directory" field, choose a directory for the ISO (use a new
   directory with nothing in it for this) Make sure to select the
   "New project" radio option
        Click the browse button on the right of the "ISO file" field and
   point it to your ISO file
   (in my case I used linuxmint-13-cinnamon-dvd-32bit.iso  from here: http://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=105
        Click "Next" and then "Yes" to confirm.

    Wait for it to do its thing for a bit, then click the button it
    presents to open a chrooted environment (it opens an xterm).  In
    the xterm:

    apt-get install build-essential
    apt-get install portaudio19-dev
    apt-get install libvorbis-dev
    apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
    apt-get install git
    apt-get install stgit
    apt-get install openscad

If the openscad package isn't around, you can get it from here:
http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html
 and then from outside the chrooted environment, copy
openscad-2013.0.x86-32.tar.gz into your chroot directory/root
   Then, back in the chrooted xterm:

   cd /root
   tar xzvf openscad-2013.01.x86-32.tar.gz
   cd openscad-2013.01/
   ./install.sh
   cd ..

   git clone https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git
   cd space-nerds-in-space/
   make

   (now Space Nerds in Space has been built within the chrooted env.)

    Once you're finished making modifications, make sure to clean up with the following commands:


    Now clean up the chrooted env (and yes aptitude takes the weird
    tilde options for some reason):

    aptitude purge ~c
    aptitude unmarkauto ~M
    apt-get clean; rm -rf /var/cache/debconf/*.dat-old; rm -rf /var/lib/aptitude/*.old; rm -rf /var/lib/dpkg/*-old; rm -rf /var/cache/apt/*.bin; updatedb
    history -c
    rm /root/.bash_history
    rm /root/.nano_history
    history -c
    exit

(xterm will close)

    Click Next
    Give your ISO a description (which will be embedded as the name of the CD
or USB stick onto which the ISO is burnt)  Don't pick too long of a name though
because if you do, it won't work.
    Click Next

Iso image will be made
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Then to run the game, burn the iso to dvd several times, and boot up all your machines from dvd.

<p>Open up a terminal, type "sudo su -"
<p>(no password -- it's a live dvd)

<p>Then, cd to space-nerds-in-space

<p>Has to be root because we installed spacenerds in space into /root/space-nerds-in-space above when
making the dvd -- this could be worked around by chowning it all to user "mint", perhaps putting it someplace
else before making he ISO image, but I don't have the exact instructions to do that, and didn't think to do it,but
if you're paranoid, you probably want to think about that.

<p>Repeat for several machines on your lan, say, five of them or so.

<p>On one machine that is connected to a projector, note the IP address:
(run ifconfig to figure this out.)

<p>Then start the snis client:

<p>./snis_client

<p>From there, start the lobby server on localhost, start the gameserver, connect to lobby, and connect to the gameserver.
<p>Note the shipname and password you use (make up what you want).

<p>On the remaining machines, start snis_client, replace the lobby host "localhost" with the ip address noted above, fill in only the shipname and password as above, and connect to the lobby, then to the gameserver. You can be choosy about the 'roles' for each station at this point, but you don't have to.

<p>That's it.

<p>edit: btw, prior to making live dvd iso's and burning a bunch of dvds, we tried to run the game in linux installed to virtual machines on the windows boxes -- that didn't work out so well, performance was kind of crap for whatever reason. With the dvds, performance was fine at least for the few minutes the network was working.

now since the game is still in a really rough state as far as playability goes.

start when the server process crashed with an assert inside pthread_mutex_lock
(no doubt a glibc bug ;-). Moved the server to another machine and ran it under
valgrind, and we played the game for about an hour with it running under
valgrind, which found nothing. Lots of rough edges with the game play that need
tuning, not to mention all the functionality that isn't in the game yet, but,
it's very good to finally have it in a playable state, more or less.

<p>The video's a bit dark, and esp. the projector screen doesn't show up very
well, next time I'll bring the DSLR, maybe that will help.

<p><b>smcameron 12 Jul 2013, 04:43</b>
<p>Just a progress update. Had a week off around July 4, and I used it to
totally re-vamp the power-system of the ship. Now all systems are modelled as a
resistive network with a fixed voltage, capped current power supply. So long as
the resistive load does not exceed the max current that can be supplied,
voltage is constant, and the requested power is delivered. When the load
requires more current than the supply can deliver, voltage drops, current
decreases. Gives a rather natural way to couple all the power consuming systems
together.

<p>Additionally, I've done a lot of work on the "DEMON" screen, and now, from
this screen, you can delete things from the universe, add things to the
universe, become a puppet-master for any non-player ship, able to drive it,
shoot the weapons, and transmit communications from any non-player ship. By
this means, you can act as game master and provide a little puppet show for the
rest of the players.

<p>Got side tracked a little bit... I was thinking about spaceship models, and
how making them by hand was difficult, and I remembered shipwright -- that
procedural spaceship generator that slams a bunch of canned, hand-made parts
together somewhat randomly, but in pairs, and in ways that maintain bilateral
symmetry, and I got inspired a little bit, though I was dissatisfied with the
results of shipwright -- which is here, btw: http://ship.shapewright.com/


<p>So, yesterday I started hacking on a little bit of openscad metaprogramming
to make me some freakin' spaceships.

<p>I called my program "ship not even wrong", (inspired by "shipwright", and by that famous quote of Wolfgang Pauli)

<p>My program is here:
<p>https://github.com/smcameron/opencscad -- in the ship-not-even-wrong
subdirectory. It relies on opencscad to produce openscad code, and of course on
openscad to process the models.

<p>Typically, a big ship will take 30000 triangles or something, so it's
probably not actually suited to Space Nerds In Space as it currently stands --
my poor little software renderer is brought to its knees by such large models.
Though I did manage to get some screen shots anyway.

<p>Incremental progress.

<p>I've added a "Tractor Beam" (that doesn't really work yet) and the Science
station can now view 3D models of whatever it's scanning, and now ships are not
all confined to the same flat plane, and I've started adding some lua scripting
abilities.

<p>Just a progress update. Converted to use opengl. I am however, still using
the software renderer, just all the 2D drawing (e.g. triangle fills) is done
with opengl. Plan is to replace the software renderer, but I'm not that far
along yet. Only real 3d stuff done with opengl so far is the skybox. Oh yeah, I
made a little (not very sophisticated) skybox program:
https://github.com/smcameron/cosmic-space-boxinator

<p>I also figured out how to get recordmydesktop to stop garbling the video
(use the --on-the-fly-encoding option.). Unfortunately it now garbles the
sound. So here's a silent video showing the new skybox.

<p>Not too much to report this week, other than that the lua scripting is
coming along and is now to the point that simple mission scripts are possible.
There are still a lot of entry points and callbacks and what not that would be
nice to have -- I'm taking it somewhat slowly to try to avoid an API explosion,
since I don't have a very good feel for the sorts of things which are a good
idea vs. a bad idea for such APIs, other than that it's probably better if the
lua API is small, rather than large.


<p>Here is a bit of documentation about the <a
href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt">Space
Nerds In Space lua API</a>, still subject to change obviously.

<p>Here are a couple of mission scripts I've made so far:

<p>* <a
href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/luascripts/TRAINING-MISSION-1.LUA">Training
misison 1</a> -- kind of a race around a circuit to dock with 4 starbases -- in
case it's not obvious (it isn't) the way to dock with a
starbase is get very close to it, then type "dock" in the comms screen. In
general, all the commnications from these scripts with the player occurs via
the comms screen.

<p>* <a
href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/luascripts/TRAINING-MISSION-2.LUA">Training
mission 2</a> -- the obvious mission, decoy mayday call leads to ambush.

<p>I am open to ideas about the sorts of things such an API should provide to
enable easier creation of a rich set of mission scripts, though I can't promise
to implement suggestions, obviously.

<p>Edit: Also, if anybody wants to take a whack at making a mission script or
two, by all means, please do, and if in so doing you run into things that the
API is missing that prevent you from being able to do what you want to do --
and are going to do -- let me know.

<p>There's a great tool for capturing opengl applications on linux, it's called
glc, and is hooking into the opengl api (LD_PRELOAD i believe) to do
high-performance screen captures, it also hooks into the audio subsystem, it
produces quite large raw files which can then be converted into
less-quite-large-files which can be read by tools such as ffmpeg to produce
nicely-sized-files.

<p>There is already some support for scripting missions with lua. It's still a
work in progress and I haven't filled in all the events and callbacks and
things or figured out what the best set of features for a scripting system are
-- taking it kind of slow in an attempt not to bloat the scripting API with
crap before I figure out what's really needed, though not having done something
like this before, It will probably end up with its share of warts anyway.


<p>You can see what the current (still subject to change) api is like here:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt</a>

<p>and some example scripts (that don't do a whole lot) here:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/tree/master/share/snis/luascripts">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/tree/master/share/snis/luascripts</a>

<p>Currently you run the scripts by going to the "demon" screen and typing eg.
"lua training-mission-1.lua" into the command box.

<p>Oh, that lua api looks neat, and the missions there shows it off well! :)

<p>I'm wondering if openscad is strictly required for building the game, does
it compile the model-files into a machine-specific format?

<p>It'd be great if the content-creation tools were only required for content
creators (most projects won't require photoshop or gimp to render .psd or .xcf
files into pngs during the build).


<p>That being said, after changing includepaths for lua, stuff compiles and
looks great! Definitely going to give scripting a go :)

<blockquote>
dusted:

</blockquote>

<p>Well, openscad is needed only to build the stl files from the scad files (to
state the obvious). I guess I don't make such a distinction in my mind between
"content-creation", and coding, esp. since "content-creation" with openscad
*is* coding. :)


<p>Originally I had dropped the stl files into github directly, but... they're relatively huge and they screwed up my graph, man... :)
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/graphs/code-frequency">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/graphs/code-frequency</a>
<p>See that giant spike around Dec 2012/Jan 2013? That's stl files. Then the giant negative spike in June 2013 is me getting rid of the stl files.

<p>Obviously if the game is built and packaged up into RPMs or .deb or
whatever, the stl files will be in there pre-built (presuming I don't move to
something more complicated allowing texturing, etc. at some point) but for what
goes into github as "source", I think having the scad files and not having the
stl files is the right decision.

<p>BTW, if you make any cool mission scripts, send me a patch/pull request.
And, if there's something you find yourself needing from the lua api that's not
there right now (quite likely) let me know and we can hash out what should be
done.

<p>That's fair enough, i wondered if maybe it was something like size.. :)

<p>I don't know if you're interested, but I've setup a build-server for SNIS

<p><b>smcameron 11 Oct 2013, 14:47</b>
<p>dusted, that's awesome, thanks!

<p>It's probably getting to be time to add a "dist" target to the makefile that
does more or less what your build script does.

<p>I have been thinking (not very much, but some) about what form this game
might best be distributed for people that just want to play it, rather than
hack on it, and I think this game is a little different than most. Since it's
(at the moment) a linux-only game, and since it requires several people to be
in the same location with a bunch of linux computers in order to play -- well,
that is a very tall order, and most people probably won't be able to meet it.
To help them meet it, we could build a bootable linux distro on a USB flash
drive image with the game on it. Then, all they do is download the image, blast
it onto a bunch of USB flash drives, boot up all their various computers from
the flash drive, et voila!

<p>Of course, to get into the business of distributing an entire linux distro,
while still compiying with the GPL to distribute source upon request, etc....
maybe there are complications with that. And in the unlikely event the thing
got popular, that could eat a lot of bandwidth. So, i dunno.
<hr>
<p><b>dusted 11 Oct 2013, 14:52</b>
<p>Building the dist needn't be much trouble, as a single link to the upstream
dist would suffice as "source" I think.
<p>Building a "going to work without
too much hassle" usb dist is likely more
difficult, maybe based on knoppix or another of the live-dists

<p>I'm glad it may be useful, I'll follow the project and update the buildscript accordingly to the makefile changes. :)
<p>I'm using ccache to speed up compilation, so the CC parameter is useful.
<p>The server is on a 100 mbit upload, so it can handle a bit of traffic, and
you're free to deeplink to the files, I've configured it to keep latest 10
builds, so using the "lastSuccess" link is propably useful.

<p>Sorry for spamming, wanted to say that fresh 32 and 64 bit binaries can be downloaded here, these may not be correctly packaged, please correct me if I've made any mistakes.
<p>I also implemented a simple caching system for the stl files from the scad files, so those will only be generated if they change.
<p>These builds are not officially supported and I've made them on my own initiative, so if you have trouble with them, complain to me first.

<p>It's been a little while since I posted an update, and if you've only been
casually watching the github page, you might have thought not much was going
on, but if you dug a little deeper, you'll have seen that there's plenty going
on, just not on the "master" branch.


<p>It's been just a little over a year since I began this thread with the bare
beginnings of a network game. In the original conception, the game was
primarily a 2-dimensional game that happened to have a 3-d "out the window"
view. Since then, and esp. in the last month, a lot of progress has been made
in turning this primarily 2-dimensional game into a real 3-dimensional game.
It's been a heavy battle, and many matrices have been manipulated and
quaternions grokked.


<p>So, here's a little update video showing some of the new stuff. It's still
not really ready for prime time, but in case you want to play with the new toys
anyway, the code is on the "more-coord-fixing" branch on github.

<p>A quick suggestion, but I don't know whether you already implemented
something like that already.

<p>Why not add (simulated) non-bridge crew? They can get wounded or even die
when their post gets hit. Each crew member could have its own qualities, making
it suited for a certain posting.

<p>If crew starts getting wounded or (god forbid) start dieing, the system(s)
they are posted start running less smoothly or stop getting repaired. This
makes sure the bridge crew is more careful with the ship.

<p>When the ship is running smoothly, the non-bridge crew can spend time
optimizing the various systems of the ship. Causing the various ship systems to
slowly improve in effectiveness.

<p>Crew could be shuffled around, to affect things like repair or (re)charge time.

<p>Thanks for the idea, I will consider it. I am afraid though that there are many
higher priority things which will need to be done before I can get to that. If
I make a list of all the things that need to be done before I can have
something which is a complete and playable game, there are many sort of "basic
functionality" things that remain to be done, and at least to some extent, I
try to choose what I work on with the goal of getting to a complete game in

<p>This looks fantastic! It's amazing to browse this topic and see how far
you've progressed. I noticed some of your videos had classical music playing in
the background, but are you planning to add any other music at some point?
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 13 Dec 2013, 13:32</b>
<p>Hi, and thanks for the kind words. There is a more cool stuff coming soon.

<p>As for music, I'm not sure. In the very early days of home computers, just
making any sound at all was a novelty, and if your game could play music, or --
oh miracle! -- even *talk*, this was quite a neat thing. Nowadays, that sort of
novelty is gone, as computers can easily reproduce any sound, or video, or what
have you. So, in one way of thinking about it, it doesn't make sense any more
to have some particular music to go with the game, any more than your
automobile should have a theme song to go with it that starts up every time you
drive it (well, even that might be cool for a little while, but only because
your car would be the *only* car with such an absurd thing, but it would still
wear thin.)

<p>Now I am quite aware that music is a powerful thing for setting a mood, and
ideally, we'd all have John Williams in our game room conducting an orchestra
performing an extemporaneous composition which varies seamlessly on the fly to
suit whatever is happening in the game, like a real time film score. But that's
not happening, of course. Next best, we might have some music composed that is
broken into little component pieces that can be mixed and matched on the fly to
make a kind of robotic simulation of John Williams piecing together something
to suit the game play. This is really hard, although there have been some
attempts (iMuse springs to mind: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMUSE ) Doing
something like that is likely beyong my abilities, and even if it weren't, it
probably wouldn't be that good. Next best, we can just strap some canned music
into the game (e.g.: Brahms Tragic Overture seems like a reasonable fit, and
there is a fairly decent free recording around:
<a href="https://musopen.org/music/1567/johannes-brahms/tragic-overture-op-81/">
https://musopen.org/music/1567/johannes-brahms/tragic-overture-op-81/</a>
) However, this gets old
on repeated exposure, and is not really much superior to just letting the
player cue up whatever he likes on his media player of choice in the
background.

<p>So now I'm down to maybe I just provide a "suggested listening" list to
accompany the game? You could do worse than to just crank up Pandora and type
in "john williams" and let 'er rip.

<p>-- steve

<p><b>andrewj 14 Dec 2013, 11:53</b>

OpenGL shaders and such within the Space Nerds In Space codebase, we now how
alpha-blending texture-mapping shaders to render lasers, torpedoes and sparks
and such, and I'm sure more exciting and beautiful things will be coming soon.

<p>Other changes: The damage control robot can actually repair stuff now too. A
lot of improvement to the client side object movement interpolation code was
done as well, so things move a lot more smoothly than they previously did. Lots
of other small miscellaneous changes too numerous to mention, consult the
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/commits/master">history</a>
if you need more (too much) detail.

<p>On another topic: I know a few people are trying to run this thing on
Raspberry Pis. It was never really a design goal that it should run on
Raspberry Pis, though I was happy to see people try it, esp. back before any
OpenGL code was added. Now that the OpenGL barn door is opened though, it
appears to be leaking into many of the screens besides just the "Main Screen"
(Nav, Weapons, and Science, for example.) I do not see this trend abating as
development continues, the sexy graphics are just too alluring. Much as I like
the idea of SNIS on Rasp. Pi, the little machine may simply not be sufficiently
powerful for it.

<p>Space Nerds In Space April 2014 Development update.

<P>Kind of slacking off lately in terms of committing code to Space Nerds In
Space. That's ok, it's expected that there will be occasional lulls in momentum
for any hobby project of this size. Look at Word War vi -- plenty of gaps in
the commit history when enthusiasm waned.

<p>Anyway, I have by no means abandoned the project. Here's a little video of
what's new this month:

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJRhO7ur8YA" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJRhO7ur8YA&feature=youtu.be</a>

<p>The audio isn't sync'ed to the video, and the video runs out before the audio finishes, ... oh well.

<p>Most notably, I've been getting into emulating some fluid dynamics stuff to try
to get decent textures for gas giant planets. I've made some progress mostly by
pursuing the ideas in this paper: <a
href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph2007-curlnoise.pdf">Curl
Noise For Procedural Fluid Flow</a> by Bridson, Hourihan and Nordenstam. You
can the current state of my experiments here: <a href="https://github.com/smcameron/curly-vortex">Curly Vortex on github</a>.

<p>What it looks like in game so far (this is not committed because I'm not yet satisfied with it.)
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0NeWGFN.png">
<p>The fluid flows on that planet image were simulated (faked) on 6 square
faces of a cube arranged in a field of perlin noise with particles moving to
adjacent faces when they leave another face. This works ok, but not great,
leaving visible artifacts (though less artifacts than wrapping a seamless
rectangle around a sphere). It also does not work well if you want to introduce
belts of counter rotating flows parallel to the equator of the planet -- things
get a little too tricky for me near the edges of faces and on the top and
bottom squares of the cube. I think the better way to do it is do the flows in
real 3d on the surface of the sphere, then generate the cube map textures from
that data, which is what I'm currently working on, but it's not really there
yet.

In the mean time, here some examples of 2D fluid flows with horizontal bands of
flows alternating between left and right with chaotic zones between. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/MomQL#vMtQwyo">imgur

<p>Yeah, I think I know how to do it, just need to actually do it, and debug
it. I don't think I can run the sim on the faces of the cube map easily, or I
can't figure out how to get rid of velocity discontinuities at the edges of the
faces, and it makes doing counter rotating velocity bands more complicated than
I can deal with. After trying for awhile I have concluded it would be easier to
do the sim in 3d proper, and get the cubemap images from the 3d data.
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 28 Apr 2014, 04:52</b>
<p>So I have spent the last several days trying to do a proper 3D version of my fake fluid flow stuff.

<p>Having some problems.

<p>1. Cannot seem to get a divergence free velocity field on the surface of a
sphere like I can for a 2D plane. Not totally sure why. Might have to do with
error deciding if the noise gradient is "uphill" or "downhill". Adding a fudge
factor to correct (somewhat) for one error in that area helped (reduced
divergence) but what i thought should be a perfect correction was worse than
the fudge factor. So... yuck. Not sure what's going on there.

<p>2. Still have issues with discontinuities at cubemap face boundaries. Drat.
The whole point of doing the sim in real 3D was to get rid of those. Haven't
really tried to debug that, might turn out to be something simple, but... not
happy to see those discontinuities.

<p>3. libpng sucks. :) The initial particle colors are taking from an starting
image. Right now that image must be 1024x1024 or it won't work. That's due to
me not being able to figure out wtf is going on with libpng. Seems like it
should be simple, but... it is the exact opposite of simple. Or I'm suffering
some kind of brain lock on the issue, I don't know. Spent entirely too much
time on it before just manually scaling the input image to the same size as the
output images and giving up on that aspect for the time being. (if 1 and 2
can't be solved, 3 doesn't matter.)

<p>Oh, btw, if you want to play with this mess, I checked it into master of
space-nerds-in-space repo on github. The program is gaseous-giganticus. You
will need a 1024x1024 png image as a starting point in the current directory
that is named "gas.png" (you have to make this yourself. I suggest some cropped
image of sedimentary rock formations from arizona found by google image search.
Antelope canyon is also a good gis term. but anything will do, so long as it is
cropped/scaled to 1024x1024 and name gas.png.) Then it will dump out (and
overwrite, many times) files called tmpg-0.png (and 1,2,3,4,5 as well as 0).
You can view those with, e.g. gqview or other image viewing program, and also
mapped onto a sphere with mesh_viewer (part of space nerds in space code) by
"mesh_viewer -p tmpg-" command.

<p>A pic of one cube map face output. The gray areas, and esp. gray areas
bordered by black with particles leaving the area are the divergences.

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ieO23PX.png">

<p>And on a sphere:

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MR82L8j.png">

<p>Those are with, iirc, 1M particles. 8M particles looks a bit better
(divergences are somewhat hidden by the mass of particles.)

<p>Anyway, as libpng sucks, I usually use stb_image:

stbi_load at stuff and you get an array of pixels back). That's, unless you got

<p>Hi,

<p>I've recently discovered Space Nerds In Space, and I'm totally impressed,
but i can't shake the feeling that it wouldn't be amiss to suggest the author
of SNIS take a(nother?) look at a GPL'd game called Pioneer Space Sim
(<a href="http://pioneerspacesim.net">http://pioneerspacesim.net</a>)..

<p>Both SNIS and Pioneer are GPL'd games. It seems like they should.. like.. go
on a date, maybe.. at least flirt a little.

<p>It would be a wonderful path to greatly expand the universe SNIS is shaping
up to take place in, and it would certainly benefit Pioneer to have an angle on
becoming an excellent multiplayer game...

<p>anyway, i just wanted to register, and put my two cents in on it. These are
both incredibly good works of space nerdery, I thoroughly enjoy both games,
it'd be a shame if they didn't at least know about each other.. maybe some
sexting?

<p>Alas, i am not much of a developer myself. I have no way to assess both
codebases and know how surmountable any integration might be.. For all i know,
from a coding standpoint, it's a ridiculous suggestion.. It's.. just.. the
conditions both games exist under.. the general rising climate of the
popularity of space nerdery.. it's.. now just seems like an amazing time to
suggest such.. um.. couplings..

<p>as a space nerd reveling in this sudden outburst of awesome games (on linux,
no less) out in the world, just imagine for a moment...

I'm aware of Pioneer. Merging the projects isn't going to happen for a variety
of technical reasons, and I'll leave it at that. That being said, I have from
time to time peeked at their shader code, and they're welcome to use, for
example, my gas giant planet texture generator if they wanted to.

<p>Hi Charlie. Sorry about the radio silence on the SNIS front. I have been
looking for a job lately, so that has taken up all of my time for the past
month. As far as "... crap version of SNIS!" LOL! If you take a look again at
the very first post in this very thread you'll notice that this "crap version
of SNIS", called "Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Simulator" is in fact one and the
same as the very inspiration for SNIS. And before I even got very far with it,
I emailed Thom Robertson to be sure he was ok with me re-using the same basic
idea -- not that doing so was necessary, but it just seemed a decent thing to
do. With his blessing, I proceeded with SNIS.
<hr>
<p><b>Pollux568 13 Dec 2014, 19:25</b>
<p>Hi smcameron,

<p>just a small note to say that I discovered the concept of bridge simulator
with Artemis last year. Then I've heard about the SNIS project, and I have been
really really interested. There are some features which makes this game more
interesting than Artemis in my point of view, above all the full 3D
displacement, the far bigger world with more realistic distances, the feeling
of an alive world (with many ships). And the total compatibility with Linux
(I've tested it on my Linux Mint distribution, works perfectly :) ).

<p>One thing prevents me however to organize LAN party on the subject, it is
the lack of missions/objectives (but I might have missed a point). Although it
is an open world sandbox game, it could be interesting to have global
objectives (for example, destroy an enemy base or escort another ship).

<p>I can't wait for further improvements of the game, keep motivated, it is worth !
