<p>Hello Pollux568, and thanks for the kind words.

<p>I am aware of the lack of missions, etc. within SNIS. There is some
capability for missions, but it is a bit, let's say half-baked and
under-documented.

<p>If you switch to the "demon screen", and type in "lua abc.lua", and if there
is a script in share/snis/luascripts named ABC.LUA (has to be uppercase -- you
could consider that a bug) it will run the script, which can do many things.
There are some example scripts in share/snis/luascripts which you may want to
take a look at.

<pre>
CLEAR_ALL.LUA
COLLISION.LUA
HELLO.LUA
initialize.lua
SAVING-PLANET-ERPH.LUA
SILLY-SPACE-BATTLE.LUA
TRAINING-MISSION-1.LUA
TRAINING-MISSION-2.LUA
</pre>
So, for example, you can go to the "demon screen" and type "lua
saving-planet-erph.lua" and it will run that script. You can take a look at the
scripts and potentially make your own missions. Documentation (what there is of
it) for what the scripts can do is in lua-api.txt See:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt</a>
My hope was that users might create some mission scripts for SNIS. The api
isn't set in stone yet though, but I do try to not break the api unnecessarily
and not adding stupid things to the api that will need to be changed later
(time will tell if I am successful at not breaking it.)

So I guess what I am saying is that I'm aware of the lack of missions, and have
tried to put in some infrastructure to allow missions be built for the game.
The missions generally have to make heavy use of the comms system to be able to
inform the player of what is supposed to do (generally, making starbases
pretend to make requests for the players to go do stuff.) I am not sure how
well that scheme really works, but I'm not sure how else to do it.

On another topic, to explain the lack of development activity on SNIS lately,
about 3 months ago, in an interesting twist, I ended up not having a job for a
bit, and spent about a month getting a new job -- which worked out pretty well,
I think, since I did get a job at, of all places, GOOGLE! So, for the last 2
months, I have been doing nothing but trying to get my house ready to sell so
that I can move across the country. Consequently, for the last 3 months, I have
not worked on Space Nerds In Space at all. Once I start working again (in about
2 weeks!), I expect it will likely eat my brain for quite a while until things
settle down to some sense of normalcy at which time maybe I can get back to
working on SNIS some more.

Thanks for giving SNIS a try.

<p>So, getting settled in at my new job, had some time today to play around
with gaseous-giganticus, the procedural gas giant texture generation program
that is part of Space Nerds In Space, and so I made a little video about how to
use it. Well, the audio isn't sync'ed to the video, and the video runs too fast
(which, in this case is probably a good thing as it's a demo of a rather
compute intensive and slow program.) This lets you get to see it actually
working, instead of only still shots of the output of the program, which might
be interesting.

<p>Thanks. I don't think the game had much to do with getting the job, except
indirectly, as I (re)learned some things while programming the game about
TCP/IP and multithreaded programming, and knowing those things may have come in

<p>I have made a fun little experiment with morphing nebulae. It is right now only
a half-baked implementation in that the morphing happens entirely on the client
and no attempt is made to keep different clients to have the same morphing
behavior so that all clients see a consistent view. It's a fairly subtle
effect, and I am not sure it's worth it in that it's really just something
that's fun for me as a programmer, but doesn't really add anything to the game
play, so this might not ever actually make it into the game.

<p>Refined the motion of the tentacles a bit... still not checked in.
Everything is done server side right now and network traffic is 3 quaternions
plus x,y,z for each joint of each tentacle -- 8 tentacles, 10 joints per
tentacle... 4 floats per quaternion... means 15 floats per joint * 80 joints *
4 bytes per float == 4800 bytes per spacemonster per update. Need to push a
bunch of this to the client side so it doesn't need to go over the network. So,
still just in the proof of concept stage at this point.

</blockquote>

<p>It's not quite that easy. The "animation data" is procedurally generated on the
fly. The trick is to get all the clients to generate exactly the same data at
the same time, and allow for late joiners. It's not unsolvable, but not super
easy either. For now, I sidestep the problem by generated on the server once
and distributing to the clients -- I think I will continue to do it that way,
but find a way to drastically shrink what's generated on the server (e.g. maybe
I pass a new random seed around to all the clients to seed a per-creature
random number generator so the clients can all generated the same data at the
same time -- which is pretty much your same idea.)
<hr>
<p><b>Vandar 12 Apr 2015, 21:04</b>
<p>I've been using seeded procedural content generation in a few projects of mine,
and it works quite fine. So passing the seed and, if needed, additional
parameters to the rng of all clients will produce exactly the same outcome on
all clients - assuming that your messaging is monotone ordered, i.e. messages
are interpreted in the same sequence on all clients (clients still can lag
behind, important is only that the sequence is the same).

<p>Good luck :)

Following this project made me want to add a 3D flight module to my own space
exploration game variant. 5 hours learning OpenGL and looking at code examples,
und uncounted thoughts of swear-words later, I finally have the basics
together. Should be good enough to display something in between Elite and
Frontier style worlds, but I'm not sure if I'll go into procedural planet
generation like Frontier had it ... now I must couple the display module with
the rest of the game.
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 15 Apr 2015, 02:54</b>
<p>Cool. Adding 3D to a 2D game isn't easy for a variety of reasons. Enemy AI,
steering, shooting, etc. becomes harder. Making the gameplay fun becomes (to
me) more difficult. It's such a fundamental change that you risk damaging the
game, or adding so much complexity to it that you can't finish it. The one
piece of advice I'd offer is make sure you use consistent coordinate systems
everywhere -- that is, x, y, and z axes always point the same way and you
always use a consistent handedness of the coord systems used in the game
universe and in the rendering system -- Opengl is going to want to most
naturally use a particular coordinate system, don't fight it, modify your game
to use that coordinate system rather than converting between that coordinate
system and a different one within your game. Failing to do that when I first
began adding 3D to my game lead to untold hours of debugging insanity. My first
attempt failed because of this, and a 2nd attempt involved going back and
fixing the coordinate systems to be consistent, and I probably would have
failed a 2nd time if not for the help of my friend Jeremy -- or at least it
would have taken a lot longer than it did.
<hr>
<p><b>Vandar 15 Apr 2015, 10:48</b>
<p>Well, the history of the project is long ... briefly said, it's been 3D data
wise all the time, but there was only a map-like projection of space. No
enemies, no fights. It's about exploration. Now I'm adding a new view for the
data, showing space flight in 3D. Question is, if I want to use billboard
sprites for planets, or make them 3D models, furthermore if I want to use
procedural generation for the planets (which would be an interesting thing to
do). And I'm afraid, once there are visible planets in space, players will want
to land there.

<p>Finishing the project ... um, probably will never happen. I started in 1995
or so when I was fascinated by Elite II - Frontier, worked on it for a while,
had to dump a lot of code due to technology changes, started over with a new
code base, dumped the new codebase, resurrected parts of the old code,
translated it from C++ to Java and gave it a new Swing-based UI. At the moment
it's not about completing something but a "I want to see if this works", which
means embedding OpenGL in a Swing UI driven game. As a side effect I'm learning
more about OpenGL, but more or less unintended.

I am guessing from looking at this image:
http://forum.freegamedev.net/download/file.php?id=9300&mode=view that you are
using some noise to generate the terrain. How are you picking your colors? To
me it looks like your land is too "green" and your water is too light. I have
experimented some and had good luck with picking colors by indexing into a
color texture with one axis (in my case, vertical axis) being specified by
altitude, and the other axis being specified by a 3D noise function.  For land,
and water, respectively, these color picking textures worked pretty good:

<hr>
<p><b>Vandar 04 May 2015, 15:26</b>
<p>I'm using hand-coded color maps and simpex noise. I suspect that you have
both, superior color maps (the textures that you showed), but also a superior
noise function, or at least you make better use of your noise function, so that
it creates swirly structures and details like the rivers. Better color maps
will help my code, too, but adding more complexity to the noise function seems
to be a problem, I doubt the player wants to wait more than minute to have the
stellar system generated. Actually even 10 seconds of wait appear long ... but
with some time there will come ideas :)

<p>PS: I think the biggest difference is the fact that you have a 2-dimensional
color picking system, while I have a 1-dimensional one that only uses height.

<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 05 May 2015, 03:53</b>
<p>The rivers and things come about because in my heightfield generation code,
I sample real earth elevation data from images that I got from here:
<a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=73934">http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=73934</a>
and use it to modulate my
generated terrain E.g. I add a big circular pimple onto my planet, but then
essentially multiply the pimple heightfield by a sampled region of some real
terrain data, and keep doing that over and over. if the edges of the pimple I
am adding into the surface have height zero, then after muliplying, they're
still zero. Consequently it all fades together nicely, and I can add in
zillions of such wrinkly terrain-modulated pimples and it all blends together.
That part probably is pretty tough to do on the GPU I expect. Improving your
color picking is probably do-able though.
<hr>
<p><b>Vandar » 05 May 2015, 14:43</b>
<p>My planets are precalculted too, so I could do a lot more detailed
calculations as well. At the moment creating the Werteizin system with its 24
bodies takes between 1 second and 20 seconds, depending on the texture size and
triangle count. One second is fine, 20 seconds stress the players patience
quite a bit. I'll try to improve my color maps, the last incarantions of some
planet types already look better than the early ones. Some others are in real
bad shape, though.


<p>Thanks for your tips, it's interesting to learn how you creature such fine planets :)

<p>Previously, I seem to recall someone suggesting that I should work on the
color scheme of the UI of Space Nerds In Space, as what's there now is a
somewhat haphazard mishmash of nominal primary and secondary named colors.
Well, I have not really revamped the colors, in fact they are currently the
same as they've always been. But, I have made it possible to modify the colors
of nearly every UI element independently via a simple config file. Well, it's
not as easy as it probably could be, and the names for all the ui elements are
probably slightly opaque, but it is tweakable by mere mortals. For example, In
a few minutes, I tweaked the colors of the Navigation screen to get this:
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3f0Dvbo.png">
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 13 Jul 2015, 07:55</b>
I cooked up a new system for docking with starbases. Now the NAV screen has a
button to engage or disengage docking magnets, and starbases can have docking
ports. When you approach a docking port with the magnets engaged, then you
dock. To undock, turn of the docking magnets. This still isn't complete -- but
the concept works at least.

<p>Another docking demo video. In the previous video, you could "dock" with a
docking port, but it didn't actually do anything -- to have the systems on your
ship repaired and replenished, you still had to dock the old way, which was
just to get on comms and request to dock while floating vaguely next to a
starbase. Now, requesting permission to dock via comms gets you only that --
permission to dock for a period of 3 minutes. During that three minutes, you
can dock with a docking port, and get your ships systems repaired and
replenished. If you don't dock within 3 minutes, the permission expires, and
you'll have to ask again. Attempting to dock without first asking permission
via comms won't work. Pressing F1 while on the navigation screen gives a
summary of the process.

<p>I think you need sdl-dev. e.g:

<p>libsdl1.2-dev - Simple DirectMedia Layer development files

<p>Then "apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev".

<p>Well, the above is for ubuntu 14.04 (actually Mint 17 -- derived from ubuntu 14.04) which is different than what you're running, so, it might be different.
<p>Try "apt-cache search sdl-dev", and it will tell you which sdl-dev you need.

<p>In any case, I think sdl is only used by mesh_viewer, which is a tool for viewing models, but which is not actually used in the game. So you may be able to get by without sdl if you can get the build to proceed without mesh_viewer.

<p>I haven't built it myself on Mac, though I know it has been done by at least one other person, although I am not sure it has been done recently (within the last year or so.)

<blockquote>
    In general, I think this project would benefit from some build instructions, as it is not as simple as 'git clone, then make'.
</blockquote>


<p>True. Send me a patch? ;) There are some build instructions here:
https://smcameron.github.io/space-nerds-in-space/ although they are in the
context of creating a bootable image. If you're not creating a bootable image,
then the parts you're interested in begin after you're in the chrooted
environment. Granted, those instructions don't mention libsdl-dev. It is hard
to fighure out all the build dependencies when, as in my case, you already had
most of them installed before you began. And it is even harder to track them
across multiple linux distros. My strategy is to try to make the game good
enough that I just keep the source on github and hope that other people will
find it worthwhile to package it up for all their various distros. Not entirely
successful so far, but that's ok too.

<p>Are you ever planning on restructuring the project so you don't have the bulk of the game files in one directory, or so that it builds to a separate directory?

<p>Has anyone made progress on building for Windows (or know of some obvious reason why it's not worth trying)? All your libraries seem to be cross-platform, and the big obvious hurdle I see right now is the lack of an apt-get alternative and a built-in pkg-config.

<p>Not a lot of progress on that front. Jeremy was for a time working on an SDL
port (moving away from gtk) but, that has stalled, I guess (to be fair, we both
got pretty demanding new jobs at the beginning of this year, so free time is a
bit scarce). Not that gtk can't be compiled for Windows (and has been done
before on my other game, Word War vi, though I don't know if gtkglext works
with Windows). From my perspective... windows has enough games, and, if people
are crying that the game doesn't work on Windows, well, shoe's on the other
foot now isn't it? How does it feel? :)


<p>It occurs to me that the joystick code uses linux-specific ioctls, so that
won't work on mac or windows -- but joysticks aren't really a big part of this
game, so that's no matter -- actually I haven't tested the joystick code in
ages. (on second look, I forgot somebody already ported the joystick code to
windows for word war vi, so it might work on windows.)

<p>To be honest, this response took me by surprise. I've been a professional
software engineer for 20 years now and I've never worked on a project set up
this way. It would be easier for people to contribute if they know what's going
on in the code, and having source files broken down into logical groups helps
with that. Also, building into the source directory makes it really hard to
package up the game for distribution, if you (or I) ever wanted to do that.
Also, building into the source directory means that a mistake in the makefile
could overwrite your source.

<p>Obviously, this is your project and you'll run it as you see fit, and all
these reasons are mostly conveniences. I'm looking forward to getting my

</pre>

only 158 C source files and ~75k lines of code. So as these things go, this
project is fairly small, and relatively speaking, it's not really hard to find
anything. There is likely nothing you cannot find with a single grep (even what
little token pasting is done is augmented with comments to enable grepping).
Contrast with the asset importing library "assimp" (
http://assimp.sourceforge.net/ ) which last I checked was around 300k lines of
code, and all it does is import 3D assets (incidentally, this is why I wrote my
own asset importing code -- 2700 lines of it, roughly -- I can understand and
debug 2700 lines a hell of a lot easier than the 300k of assimp.) And, have you
ever watched someone work with a C++ codebase with visual studio? Almost
invariably, they *have no idea* where anything is defined, unless they are the
ones that wrote the bit of code they are looking at, and even then, it's iffy.
They use the IDE to navigate the code. What file any particular piece of code
is in does not matter for purposes of making the code easier to understand, and
this only gets more true as the codebase grows (e.g. if your code base is
multiple millions of LOC, you better have good tools, because you're not going
to learn your way fluently around it any time soon.) Now, I don't use visual
studio. I use vim and gcc and make. The more files there are, the more files
there are to search through. There are a few reasons to break things up into
separate files. That a file is merely large is not one of those reasons.
Breaking a large file up into smaller ones only *for the sake of making the
files smaller* makes things *harder* to find, not easier. The two largest C
files in SNIS are snis_client.c and snis_server.c and they are both roughly 13k
lines each -- not really all that big. The next biggest file is 3k lines.

And I have and do separate functionality out into separate files to form
modules -- and if you take the time to look, you'll see that I am fairly
diligent about defining reasonable interfaces and not polluting the global
namespace unnecessarily and things like that. Is it perfect? No. But it doesn't
need to be perfect. But in any case, you are talking about moving things around
into different directories, rather than busting up files, and more
specifically, you're talking about separating the build artifacts from the
source files specifically by means of directories (they are already separated
by naming conventions, mostly.)

<blockquote>
    Also, building into the source directory makes it really hard to package up the game for distribution, if you (or I) ever wanted to do that. 
</blockquote>

<p>With that, I concede you may have a point. This has nothing to do with how
hard or easy the code is to understand though. And as a counterpoint, there is
already some packaging of snis going on around the net,
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/snis-git/ and moving things around would
presumably break them (though possibly make it easier for them in the long
run.)

<blockquote>
    Also, building into the source directory means that a mistake in the makefile could overwrite your source.
</blockquote>

<p>As could a mistake with the "rm" command, or any number of other shell
commands. We have git and stacked git I don't think that overwriting the source
accidentally via the specific vector of a Makefile mistake is a concern worth
worrying about. git reflog will correct most such mistakes.


<p>Moving files around may also introduce discontinuities in the git history --
"git log --follow..." is supposed to mitigate that, but, I am not super
confident that it works perfectly.

<blockquote>
Obviously, this is your project and you'll run it as you see fit, and all these reasons are mostly conveniences. I'm looking forward to getting my Artemis group to give this a try.

</blockquote>


<p>So, the point about packaging seems like it could be a legitimate one, but
there are tons of other bits of software out there that build in a similar
manner (the typical "./configure", "make", "make install" steps) that don't
seem to have any trouble getting packaged up despite dropping build artifacts
right next to source files.


<p>And, while making a game is a goal for me, it is really a secondary goal --
the primary goal of this thing is for me to have a project to have fun
tinkering with. Moving files around to different directories, potentially
making the git history ugly... it's a little hard for me to get very excited
about it.

And here's the source, which includes the dictionary (although there's no license): http://fantasynamegenerators.com/scripts/spaceshipNames.js 

It's a simpler generator, as it only uses a single dictionary with an optional prefix acronym like "SS". It's made by the guy who's making Spryke

Because getting a few friends together into a room with a bunch of linux
systems wasn't quite hard enough, I have been experimenting with adding "warp
gates" into Space Nerds In Space. Normally, there's a single server process
which simulates the universe, and a number of client processes through which
players interact with that server process. Well, I say the server simulates
"the universe", but really, there's one big star in the center, a few planets,
and a bunch of asteroids, along with a big fake starry sky as a back drop. It
feels a little small, more like a solar system. So I thought, hey, it'd be kind
of cool if you could run multiple server processes, each running their own
"solar system", and have a way to travel from one to the other. That's what
warp gates do. I've got a proof of concept running, although some critical
pieces are still missing (e.g. when you travel from one system to another, you
actually jump into a new ship that's local to that system, and so far none of
the state of your old ship transfers to the new ship, and, what's more, if you
jump back to the old universe, you end up in your old ship, which continued on
it's journey without you when you first jumped out of the universe. So still
quite a lot of work to do to get all that straightened out, but nothing
insurmountable, I don't think.)

<p>Spent all day today working on procedural clouds of a sort. Clouds have been
in the back of my mind for quite some time, and I've been thinking of various
ways to approach the problem. This morning I had a bit of an epiphany. I
realized that my "earthlike" program, which sort of dynamically creates
heightmap "brushes" on the fly by sampling real terrain elevation data and
which it then paints onto a sphere, could also be used for clouds. Instead of
sampling terrain elevation data, it could sample (slightly processed) satellite
cloud imagery, treat it as if it were elevation data, and paint it onto a
sphere in exactly the same way. This could produce a 6 seamless cubemap images
of cloud texture. I could also modify gaseous-giganticus to take a cubemap
image set as input and use that for initial particle coloration. So I could
feed my cloud cubemap through gaseous-giganticus and see if I could get some
neat fluid-flow going to make some weather systems or something. So that's what
I've been up to all day. And it worked ok. Not quite as well as I was hoping it
would, but ok.


<p>Some images:
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/z7OyVqZ.jpg">
<p>The above image is "earthlike" sampling from some cloud images without any fluid flow from gaseous giganticus.

<p>I was looking at some images of Jupiter, and one thing that I've noticed is
that it's got these "spots" for lack of a better word -- these circular
whirlpools. My procedurally generated gas giants do not have these circular
whirlpools, though they do occasionally have a bit of rotation going on. So I
have tried to modify gaseous-giganticus to allow putting some whirlpools in by
adding some code to manipulate the velocity field. The direction of rotation
isn't always "correct" -- which is to say, comporting with the already present
rotation of the unmolested velocity field. I can probably fix that though.
Nevertheless, the experiments so far are not entirely failures. Here's one:

<p>As I have been working on making better assets for Space Nerds In Space, I
have resisted the urge to update the assets in the main repository because I
don't want to create a lot of churn as I keep dinking around with things. Also,
at some point, the art assets should probably be separated from the code. I've
also been thinking about how to distribute those assets. I don't have a very
good answer for that yet. Nevertheless I have created a new repo just for
assets. https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerd ... ace-assets

<p>With a recent commit, I have at least separated out the assets that define a
"solar system" to some extent. These assets are 1) planet cubemap textures, 2)
central "star" texture, and 3) skybox cubemap textures. I have created a simple
specification for such a combination of textures which now lives in
share/snis/solarsystems/xxx/assets.txt where "xxx" is the name of the solar
system in question. By default, there is a "default" solar system, which is the
same one that's been in the main space-nerds-in-space repository since the
beginning. I've created a new solarsystem, "tau-scorpii", which is in the new
repository, space-nerds-in-space-assets. Copying the tau-scorpii directory into
share/snis/solarsystems on all your SNIS clients and setting
SNIS_SOLARSYSTEM=tau-scorpii before invoking quickstart (or using the
--solarsystem option of snis_client) will make it use the new solar system.

<p>Nice work there on the clouds. I found good looking clouds quite difficult
to create also. Real weather systems are a tricky mix of bands, swirls and
flocks of satellite clouds.

<p>Lately there are some images going around about "real" exoplanets. Like the

<p>I wonder how they were made. The article says "artistic impression", so I
guess they have little to do with the real exoplanets looks, but on the other
hand, they look as if they were made with specific planet features in mind
(color, bands, surface type, amount of fluid/rocky parts on the surface)

Atmosphere rendering seems to cause some problems with depth sorting. By

a menu which will allow you to turn off atmosphere rendering, and then the

<p>Good question. I have not used a joystick very much with this game at all,
and for what little time I have spent using a joystick, it has been an xbox 360
controller. This also means the code has not been polished with joystick use in
mind, so I expect using a joystick on the weapons station will not be as good
an experience as it should be.


<p>For a time in 2014, I was designing for my own use a series of "consoles" --
boxes with loads of switches, buttons, lights, knobs, faders, joysticks, etc, a
unique one for each station, with a usb connection. There is some basic support
for custom input devices in the code, and I got as far as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6vwbhHMmI4">rigging up a toggle
switch to an arduino to trigger torpedoes to fire</a>. The plan I had was to run a
bridge sim with these consoles at ComicPalooza in Houston as part of the booth
for the hackerspace I was a member of at the time. As part of that plan, there
is a half-completed design for a 3D printable joystick I was trying to make

But then I got a new job and moved to California, so that was the end of
that.

<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 21 Dec 2015, 02:30</b>
<p>That is because there is no height map or normal map affecting the lighting.
The texture colors are generated (baked in) from a height map, and the craters
are splatted into the height map prior to generating the colors.

<p>My program does generate corresponding height maps and normal maps, but my
engine doesn't know how to use them. Feel free to send me a patch.

Certainly using a normal map in the lighting calculations won't get you the
kind of long shadows you see if you look up images of "lunar terminator", like
this image from NASA:
<p><img src="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/hires/a12_h_50_7438.gif">
<p>which, that would be cool, but to do that I think I'd need to do shadow
mapping, and... I so far haven't even managed to do normal mapping, so this
seems unlikely.

<p>I think the normal mapping would definitely help to make things look more
"3D", but it would probably be easy to kind of "over do" the effect and
unwittingly produce a caricature of what it really should look like.

<p>Just looking at the normal maps I currently generate, I'm pretty sure I am
already "over doing" it a bit (but since I am not actually *using* the normal
maps yet...no big deal.) You can kind of get an idea what the lighting effects
of the normal maps would be just by looking at the normal maps used as if they
were color textures:

<p>When I had been working on the planets for Solarex, they had some hundreds
of thousands of triangles already. Still a triangle spans some dozens of miles,
so only the biggest craters could have real heights.

<p>At times I think a space flight simulation must have planets in several
detail levels, or able to add details on the fly when the player gets closer to
a planet.

<p>The point when my concept failed was the low orbit, from when the surface
should become a real surface and not just an spherical image, because
descending further you'll soon fly over plains, and in between mountains. It's
not possible to keep the whole planet in memory on that level of detail, so
there must be a transition from sphere to sphere segment (and if the player
flies onward, a concept to attach new sphere segments seamlesslyy to the one
already generated). This was beyond my skills.

<p>SNIS still has superior planets compared to mine, and the craters make them
even better. Good work there!
<hr>
<p><b>andrewj 25 Dec 2015, 13:42</b>
<p>I can see on the normal map image what feels missing to me: it is basically
because there is just a rim, the whole middle of the crator (inside the rim)
seems completely flat.

<p>I would expect the inside of the crater to be more like the shape of a wok.

<p>If that is a caricature and totally unrealistic, for me that doesn't matter
if the results looks good.
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 25 Dec 2015, 19:21</b>
<p>The craters are certainly still a work in progress. That being said, about the flat interiors of the craters I will say a few things.

<p>1) It seems to be in line with photos of lunar craters, esp. the large ones:
<a
href="http://www.madpc.co.uk/~peterl/Moon/Craters/Apennines.html">http://www.madpc.co.uk/~peterl/Moon/Craters/Apennines.html</a>
I expect this is because the larger impacts essentially liquefy at the point of
impact, and so level out (but I am no lunar geologist, so that may not be
correct.)

<p>2) What you think "looks good" may be largely down to what you're expecting
to see. I've spent quite a lot of time lately looking at lunar craters, so that
flat interiors of the craters don't seem too out of place to me, at least in
the case of the larger craters.

<p>3) The craters actually do slam a bowl shaped depression into the height
map. However, the height map is of limited precision (1 bytte in the current
implementation) and if the terrain is already close to zero (likely) then it
can and often does "bottom out" ate zero, producing the flatness that you
noticed. Fixing that is probably a matter of tuning the algorithm a bit to get
a height map that's not naturally so close to zero.

<p>The main complaints I have so far with the craters are:

<p>1) the height map perturbations are tloo large scale compared to the terrain
generation height map perturbations, resulting in clipping and or overflow at 0
and at 255.

<p>2) Not nearly enough small craters.

<p>3) The colors are determined by altitude and by position in a 3d noise field
to offset into a color map. Sometimes this works well, giving the "rays" a
contrasting color, but sometimes it doesn't work well. It might be neat if the
craters actually did some kind of "color displacement". Then again what I've
got now might be good enough, esp. if I can get the normal maps working.

<p>4) Probably should only have "rays" on the larger craters, not on every crater.

<p>So yeah, I am not totally happy with the craters, but neither am I totally unhappy with them.

<p>Been a while since I made an update video. This one shows progress on the
multi-server and warp gate system that I first mentioned back in August of last
year. I am still working on it, and while I have made a lot of progress, it's a
pretty big job and I've got about 30 uncommitted patches in my current stack,
and still a ways to go. But it does now reload per-solarsystem textures on
transiting between solarsystems and that is (mostly) working now, which means
that you can quite easily *tell* when you travelled from one solarsystem to
another since the planets and skybox, etc. now look different. It is still (and
perhaps will always be) a requirement that the client have the necessary
textures resident locally, but that is a detail. And the video shows off a bit
of the fruits of the most recent adventures in normal mapping that have
monopolized this thread for the last month or so. Without further ado:

    Julius:

</blockquote>



<p>Not really, no. To do that, the game would become a first person shooter,
essentially, and I'd need an interior model of the space ship that you could
wander around, etc. This seems like a huge amount of work, and all the UI's
I've done so far would have to be... rendered to textures and pasted into
virtual monitors inside the bridge interiror, or something along those lines
(and probably redesigned and simplified to enable operating them via VR), and
it would just be a radical overhaul of the game that even if I wanted to do,
I'm not sure I'd want to bite off such a large piece of work. And all that is
ignoring any porting issues of taking a C program and getting it running on
Android, which I really don't know too much about. If I were to try to go for a
VR route, I think I'd stick to dedicated systems built specifically for it,
like the Rift (which was at one time going to support linux but I think they
may have dropped that feature -- haven't been paying attention.) I think
turning the game into a a VR FPS kind of takes away a bit from the
collaborative in-person experience of the game, which probably isn't a good
thing, since that is the main differentiating thing about the game.

<p>One could argue that having a voice activated computer that can do
everything on the ship might also take away from that experience -- what are
the players needed for if the captain can just say, "computer do this, do
that", and the thing drives itself?) But, such a computer is star trek canon,
and kind of ridiculously cool that it's actually possible to attempt to create
such a thing, and not even very difficult, so... it gets a pass. And well, the
computer cannot fire or aim the guns, and while it's a neat novelty, it doesn't
actually work so well that it's super convenient, and it can be ignored easily
if it detracts from the multiplayer in-person experience.

<p>There is a non-free game called "Pulsar: Lost Colony" that you can look up
which is a multi-player bridge sim that is done as a first person shooter style
where you wander around a virtual bridge that has virtual terminals for
stations, etc, and I know at one time they were talking about supporting
occulus rift, and even had some prototype going, but I do not know if that is
still on their full feature list. It wouldn't surprise me if they cut it or put
it on the back burner just due to lack of people able to take advantage of it
and uncertainty about the hardware or for other reasons (eg. performance
requirements). Here's a video of their prototype:

<p><b>Julius » 11 Apr 2016, 12:28</b>
<p>I don't really think you need a full walkable 3D bridge, as you basically
never move from the chair/station. What can be done very easily with the
Cardboard SDK is a stereoscopic 360° rendered picture/looping video in which
you can freely look around and interact with predefined points.

<p>The jmonkey3D engine also has a more or less ready made support for
Cardboard/Occulus etc. if that fits the bill better.

<p>While I agree that this game shines with in-person multiplayer, simple VR
support would be probably the next best thing for playing it over the internet
and communicating with your friends via voice chat.

<p>P.S.: To my own surprise the Google Cardboard works actually much better than expected (if you have the right phone/headset combination).

<p>More minor improvements in the voice recognition -- not sure it's apparent
what differences there are from the last video posted. I figured out a little
more about how pocketsphinx works, and now it understands more commands, and
more different ways of doing the same command, but it is incremental progress,
really.

<p>Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N0ILFW_ft0&feature=youtu.be">the end of August of 2015</a>
I had made a proof of concept of traveling
between multiple "universes" (really, more like solar systems) within the game.
Over the last 8 months or so I have been slowly trying to get this code stable
and working, and doing all the things it needs to be able to do (mostly having
to do with maintaining state of the player ship) to be something worth
committing. There turned out to be quite a lot of code for this, around 75
patches. I didn't clean them up quite to the level of my usual standards, but
carrying around ~70 patches for ~8 months was getting to be a little tiresome
(although <a href="http://procode.org/stgit/">stgit</a> made it tolerable). This new code is still disgustingly hacky
in the way that it works, but it is nonetheless committed, and you can try
playing with it.

<p>There is now a new process, snis_multiverse, which maintains the state of all
bridges in a small "database". This means that when you run snis_client (either
manually, or via the quickstart script) there is now a "create ship" checkbox.
The first time you use a ship name, you need to check this box, and subsequent
times, you should leave it unchecked -- that is to say, your ship is now
persistent between runs, and its state is preserved in the "database"
maintained by snis_multiverse.

<p>I am quite sure there are a lot of bugs lurking in this new code -- some I
already know about, and undoubtedly some that I don't know about. I expect
there are some races in the hand-over code when all the snis_clients on a
bridge switch to a new snis_server, and I expect there is still some ship state
that is not preserved across such switches, but at least the infrastructure to
preserve that state exists now.

<p>By default, the quickstart script will only start a single instance of
snis_server, and there will not be any warp gates in the game. But, if you
"export MULTIVERSE_TEST=1" prior to running quickstart, it will create 3
instances of snis_server -- that is to say, 3 solar systems -- and will put
warp gates near each planet, and you can buy warp gate tickets to different
solar systems from the starbases via the comms station. You are advised to use
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space-assets">additional art assets in the space-nerds-in-space-assets repository on github</a>
if you run multiple solar systems.

<p>When running in multiverse mode, every planet currently has a nearby warp gate,
and from any warp gate, you can get to every other known solar system. The warp
gates correspond 1 to 1 between every pair of solarsystems, so if you depart
from warp gate X in solarsystem A to solarsystem B, you will consistently pop
out of the same warp gate in solarsystem B, and if you depart from warp gate
X+1 in solarsystem A, you will pop out at warp gate N+1 in solarsystem B. In
the future, I think I would like to be able to have some kind of graph to
establish the possible paths of travel between warp gates to enable building a
more interesting topology of solar systems than this kind of automatic and
fully connected graph we have now.

<p><a href="http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=3710&start=25">About three years ago</a>
I implemented the damage control station with a little
robot that you can drive around to repair your ship, and this is tied into the
engineering station and power model for all the various systems of the ship. At
the time, there was a bit of discussion about whether or not this thing was
actually a good idea, or maybe not such a great idea.


<p>I have now made the damage control station "optional." It's optional in the
sense that now the "automatic" mode for the robot actually works, and if you
turn it on, then the robot can drive itself around and autonomously repair your
ship for you without any intervention. There is some intelligence to how it
chooses what to repair at any given time -- if shields or warp drive are esp.
damaged, it will fix those first, as they tend to be more critical for
survival, and otherwise choose to fix approximately the closest and most
damaged component. There is doubtless room for improvement, better
prioritization of which systems to repair first, and taking into account the
overall damage to a system, not just the damage to individual components, etc.
If you manually control the robot, you can likely do a quicker job, and make
wiser decisions about what to repair next. But if you're short a player, the
robot doesn't strictly require a human operator any more.


<p>I don't have a video for this update -- it's not all that interesting to watch.
From the programming side, the most interesting thing is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* pathfinding
algorithm</a> which is used to let the robot navigate around the deck where all the
systems reside -- not that the A* algorithm is anything new, but I think the
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/a_star.h">API I came up with</a>
is quite nice, although the implementation is nothing
special, and on a large graph, performance is suboptimal just because I didn't
bother to optimize since the graph I am searching is small (~50-100 nodes).
It's nice because the caller is not required to represent the search space in
any particular way, so long as a list of neighbor nodes may be obtained from a
given node, and so long as a cost estimate and distance estimate function can
be constructed to estimate the distance/cost between two given nodes. An
example of how to use the API is in <a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/a_star_test.c">a_star_test.c</a>.

Nice update.

<p><b>smcameron 13 Jun 2016, 04:05</b>
<p>Lately I have been working on enhancing the capabilities of the Lua API to better enable scripted missions.

<p>The Lua API is documented here: 
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/lua-api.txt</a>

<p>The following additions have been made in the last few days:

<p>You can now set asteroid speeds (between 0 and 1). This is primarily to allow stationary asteroids.
<p>You can now control the ratios of the ingredients contained within asteroids.
<pre>
	set_asteroid_speed(id, speed);
</pre>
Sets the speed of the asteroid with the specified id to the specified
value. The speed should be between 0 and 1.
<pre>
    set_asteroid_minerals(id, carbon, silicates, nickeliron, preciousmetals);
</pre>

-- sets the proportions
of carbon, silicates, nickeliron, preciousmetals. Returns 0.0 on success, nil otherwise.
May fail if id doesn't match an asteroid.

<p>Example:
<pre>
            asteroid = add_asteroid(1000.0, 1000.0, 10000.0);
            set_asteroid_speed(asteroid, 0.0);
            set_asteroid_minerals(asteroid, 90.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0);
</pre>

<p>You can now get a callback based on proximity of two objects to one another.
So you can have your mission script react when the player ventures too close to
the space-thingy in your mission scripts.
<pre>
    register_proximity_callback(callback, oid1, oid2, distance);
</pre>

-- when the objects
indicated by oid1 and oid2 are within the specified distance of one another,
the specified callback is called passing the two object ids.

<p>Example:
<pre>
            function mycallback(oid1, oid2, distance)
                    print "Player has come within 300 of starbase_x\n";
            end
            register_proximity_callback("mycallback", player_ids[1], starbase_x, 300);
</pre>

<p>Timed text windows for mission start explanations, win screens, lose screens, etc. are now supported.
<pre>
    show_timed_text(id, time_in_seconds, textstring);
</pre>

<p>shows a text screen with the given textstring for the specified amount of time
on all clients of the bridge for the given player ship id. If id is -1, then
the message is displayed on all clients of all bridges.

<p>Lua scripts can now be chained with one script starting another when it
ends. The specified script is added to a queue, and when the current script
ends, the next one on the queue begins.
<pre>
    enqueue_lua_script(scriptname);
</pre>
Queue the named lua script for execution;

<p>Many ship attributes may now be queried:

{l Code}: {l Select All Code}
<pre>
    get_ship_attribute(id, attribute_name); 
</pre>

-- returns the specified attribute of the ship. The
type depends on the attribute, though generally will be a number or a string.

<p>The attributes and their types are listed below (output of print_ship_attributes program):
The types are as follows (from key_value_parser.h):
<pre>
       's' - string
       'q' - number (uint64_t)
       'w' - number (uint32_t)
       'h' - number (uint16_t)
       'b' - number (uint8_t)
       'Q' - number (int64_t)
       'W' - number (int32_t)
       'H' - number (int16_t)
       'B' - number (int8_t)
       'd' - number (double)
       'f' - number (float)
</pre>
Though, to lua, they're all just "numbers."

<p>The attributes are as follows:
<pre>
                                     Key Type     offset       size      index

<p>Some improvements to planetary rings. I spent some time watching videos of
the Cassini flyby of Saturn. In particular this one: 
<a href="https://vimeo.com/33933151">
https://vimeo.com/33933151</a>

<p>This made me realize a few of things. 1) the rings are essentially either
opaque or transparent -- there's not a lot of translucency. 2) The side of the
rings in sunlight looks different than the opposite side, which is in shade.
So, I made a few changes to try to get things to look a bit more realistic.
Shadows tend to be stark, not subtle.

<p>Here are three views of the same planet with my changes The rings have a
light side and a dark side now.

<p>Here's a video that demonstrates some new functionality of the Lua API of
Space Nerds in Space. In particular, it demos the show_timed_text() and
text_to_speech() functions. This is a demo of the training-mission-1.lua
script, which implements a timed race in which the player has to dock at four
starbases in succession, finally returning to the first starbase to dock and
complete the race. It took me about 10 minutes to complete the circuit in this
run.

<p>I have added a new mission script, SPACEPOX.LUA

<p>SPACE POX

<p>Locate and deliver SPACE POX VACCINE to save the crew
of the ICARUS station orbiting planet BONX from the
SPACE POX which has broken out and is slowly killing
them off one by one in a series of unlikely "accidents"

<p>This mission can be kind of difficult
The biggest difficulty is finding the space pox vaccine
unless you know the trick. Then, the zarkon dreadknights
are liable to get you unless you make a quick getaway, but
your warp drive will probably not help you.

<p>Here is the script: <a
href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/luascripts/SPACEPOX.LUA">SPACEPOX.LUA</a>
(contains spoilers, obviously).

<p>Found quite a few bugs in the Lua API while making this one. It is a little
more difficult than I expected to come up with decent scenarios and implement
them.

<p>Here is some GPL'ed 3D turret aiming code someone may find useful. It does
rely on some other code (for quaternions and vectors mostly). I figured I'd
post this here since I thought other game developers might find it useful, as
getting this to work is a bit tricky. The turret may be arbitrarily oriented,
it is not required that the turret axes be aligned with any world axes, for
example. The turret is rate limited in its motion about its axes (you set the
limits.) It currently does not have enforced limits on motion about those axes
though -- the turret can pass the guns through its own base, for example. It's
on my list of things to do, but it's not done.

<p>This is, by far, the most amazing game ever! I played Artemis with our crew for
a while, that was super fun, but this is a whole new level of awesome.  The
whole "real time" effect is the best, It's like being in a real life version of
Firefly or USS Defiant. Start up the game, pull up a seat, open a beer and
hangout, until you're required to do some work. Being a member of this crew, in
this space, is like having the best job in the verse.

<p>I'm on comms and have figured out:
<p>request to dock
<p>request a towing service
<p>buy / sell mined stuff to get money

<p>-- I still haven't figured out how to re-fuel the ship, any advice here would be great... please... seriously... I really need help..
<p>otherwise our games will continue to end, with the ships voice telling us the fuel level is critical. I figure it's probably going to involve "/computer do X " or "/hail SB-01 request refuel" ??

<p>Please keep making this great game :)

<p>There are two ways to get out of the "Fuel levels critical" situation, one of which is cheating.

<p>The first way is to hail a starbase, and select option 4, "REQUEST TOWING
SERVICE". A tow ship will be dispatched to your location and tow you to the
starbase which you contacted. If you have near zero fuel, it will give you a
little bit of fuel too, so you can drive to the starbase and dock. Once you
dock with the starbase, you will be refueled. It is possible the tow ship might
get killed en route to your location, in which case it won't show up (you can
call for another one.) It's also possible for the tow ship to be attacked while
towing you, in which case it may drop you where ever you might be (middle of
nowhere) and run away. Again, you can call another tow truck in that case.

<p>To successfully dock with the starbase (after the tow truck drops you off near it) you need to:

<p>1: make sure docking magnets are engaged (there's a button on the navigation screen)
<p>2: make sure you lower your shields (it will tell you to lower your shields if you forget)
<p>3: request permission to dock while shields are down and when you're pretty close to the starbase (within 5000 units, I think. It will tell you if you're too far.)
<p>4: Navigate to a docking port on the station after permission is granted but before permission expires (you can ask permission again, of course.)

<p>The docking ports vary in appearance, but you can guess which parts of the station they are, some look like this:

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JO7gGy1.jpg">
<p>or like this:
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9jTwvFw.jpg">
<p>Once you dock with the port (by ramming it, basically), you will be
connected to it. Your ship will be refueled and repaired, and all the systems
will be turned off. To undock, turn off the docking magnets (navigation screen)
and power on your systems (engineering screen).


<p>The second (cheating) way to get more fuel is as follows. Once it starts
saying "Fuel levels Critical!", go to the DEMON screen, and type in "safemode".
The next time it says "Fuel levels Critical!", you will get your tank filled.
"safemode" also has some side effects, it prevents enemies from deciding to
attack you (if they already decided though, they don't quit.) If you type
"safemode" a second time, it toggles off (you won't lose your fuel, but enemies
might decide to attack). Safemode is a toggle. However there's no indicator of
whether it's enabled or not (I should fix it, but I only put it in to help with
debugging anyway.)

<p>A couple new features added recently:

<p>1. You can now set up to 10 waypoints on the Science station, either by
typing in X, Y, Z coordinates directly, or by marking the ship's current
position. The waypoints are selectable from the list of waypoints, or via the
short range scanner or via the long range scanner. Once selected, the green
arrow on the Navigation screen will point to the waypoint (just as it points
towards anything that Science has selected.)

<p>2. Life support system. There's a new system on the damage control screen,
life support. There are also power and coolant sliders on the Engineering
screen for life support, and a gauge for oxygen, which is produced by the life
support system (from e.g. electrolysis of water). If the life support system is
damaged (or deprived of power), it will produce less oxygen. Oxygen is consumed
at a fixed rate. If the rate of oxygen production is below the rate of
consumption, the oxygen levels will slowly decrease. If they get too low, the
crew will asphyxiate.

<p>Some minor progress on Space Nerds In Space. Improved UI sound effects (I
think), most buttons make some kind of sound now. Added tooltips to all buttons
and sliders. Now you can eject the warp core. I need to work on the warp core
ejecting mechanic to make it a bit more meaningful, but the basics are there.

<p>Been thinking about Comms, and how comms always seems to be lacking
something very meaningful to do in these bridge simulator type games, so I am
revisiting an idea I had about 3 years ago but never really pursued: Add a Real
Time Strategy game into Space Nerds In Space, and let Comms be the one to
direct the action. Here's a little demo of what I have working so far:

<p>Don't know if anyone will find this interesting, but I decided to try a
little live stream coding session. Mostly it's 30 minutes of me being slightly
puzzled. OTH, I found that "obs studio" is actually capable of doing a decent
job capturing video, unlike anything else I've tried so far that didn't involve
extra hardware.

<p>So I've got the basics working with this HOTAS joystick setup today-- not
counting the rudder pedals -- my cheapo "open box special" turned out to be
missing a RJ12 to USB adapter that's apparently needed for the rudder pedals.
D'oh! (I suspect someone broke or lost their adapter, went to Fry's and bought
this thing, extracted the adapter, then returned it, sans adapter, and then I
bought it as an "open box special.")


<p>There is now a joystick config file (example default config here: 
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/joystick_config.txt">https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/master/share/snis/joystick_config.txt</a>)

<p>Have to say, it's pretty cool!

<p>I still need to add more "functions" that are hookable to the joysticks
(e.g. Currently it's not possible to connect "Reverse", "Engage warp", "toggle
docking magnets", and other misc. things to the various joystick buttons, but
there's no reason it couldn't be, and this sort of thing I will get to in the
next few days.)

<p>In case anyone plays around with this (ha!) and adds some config for their
particular joystick, I am trying to collect such configurations, and have an
issue to do so here:

<p>So, while watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5c4c5cIik4">a
review</a> of this HOTAS joystick/throttle/rudder pedals combo, I realized that
the missing RJ12 to USB adapter is actually not a problem after all because the
throttle has an RJ12 socket into which you can plug the rudder pedals, and I
tried it out, and it seems to work, with the rudder pedals showing up as an
additional 3 axes on the throttle device.

Also, I've committed changes to allow mapping almost everything on the
Navigation screen to joystick buttons and axes.

<p>Pretty nice... although they would seem a bit out of place on a bridge
simulator (as opposed to a dog-fighting space shooter).

<p>Any other plans for input devices? Separate Android touch-screen? Steam controller?
<hr>
<p><b>smcameron 10 Nov 2017, 16:49</b>
<p>I don't think it's really out of place for the Nav console, but supposing
not everyone agrees with that, it's easy enough to not buy something like this
and not plug it in. In any case, someone specifically asked for this
capability, and it's easy enough, so I didn't see a reason not to do it.

<p>As for other input devices, no plans for phones, the steam controller should
be very easy as I presume it shows up as just another input device, so it
should just be a matter of seeing what it shows up as in /dev/input/by-id and
adding some entries into the joystick config file. But, kind of hard to do that
when I do not own a steam controller. Feel free to send patches. Github issue

<p>No, not procedurally generated. Well, the number of tentacles is variable
between 3 and 5, but that is the extent of the variation in the meshes. There
are two static meshes, one for the head, and one for each tentacle segment. The
tentacle segments are procedurally placed and moved at run time -- so maybe
procedural animation, I guess.

<p>The albedo and emittance textures are in some sense procedurally generated
offline -- in that they are bits of patterns from Gray Scott diffusion reaction
process that have been manipulated in the gimp, but ultimately they are just
static textures.

<p>The emittance is changed procedurally at run time too, so the glow effect
varies with time (I added that after I made these screen shots, so those show
full emittance.)
