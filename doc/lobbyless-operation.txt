It is possible to run snis_server and snis_clients without the lobby.

I have run snis_server on a digitalocean droplet this way, and it seemed
to work ok (1 client). There were occasional lag problems, but overall it
worked *a lot* better than I thought it would.

Here's what I did:

Compile snis_server on the droplet.  Note, I did not install all the dependencies,
just those needed to build snis_server.

  sudo apt-get install build-essential;
  sudo apt-get install pkg-config;
  sudo apt-get install liblua5.2-dev;

  git clone https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git

  make bin/snis_server

You will have to open up the firewall to allow your port:

  export MYPORT=10007 # or some port of your choosing
  sudo ufw allow ${MYPORT}

(Later, when you no longer want this allowance, "ufw status numbered", and then
"ufw delete xx" where xx is the number of the rule to delete.)

Then run the server

  export SNISSERVERNOLOBBY=1 # suppress lobby
  export SNISSERVERPORT=${MYPORT} # or some port number of your choosing.
  ./bin/snis_server -L x

To connect to it with snis_client without a lobby, run on your local machine:

  ./bin/snis_client --nolobby --serverhost serveripaddr --serverport myport --starship myship --pw myshippw

Replace serveripaddr with the IP addr or host name of the server host, and myport with the port
snis_server is running on, and myship and myshippw with your ship name and ship password.
