It is possible to run snis_server and snis_clients without the lobby.

I have run snis_server on a digitalocean droplet this way, and it seemed
to work ok (1 client). There were occasional lag problems, but overall it
worked *a lot* better than I thought it would.

Here's what I did:

Compile snis_server on the droplet.  Note, I did not install all the dependencies,
just those needed to build snis_server.

  sudo apt-get install build-essential;
  sudo apt-get install pkg-config;
  sudo apt-get install liblua5.2-dev;

  make snis_server

You will have to open up the firewall to allow your port:

  MYPORT=10007 # or some port of your choosing
  sudo ufw allow ${MYPORT}

Then run the server

  export SNISSERVERNOLOBBY=1 # suppress lobby
  export SNISSERVERPORT=${MYPORT} # or some port number of your choosing.
  ./bin/snis_server -L x

To connect to it with snis_client without a lobby, run on your local machine:

./bin/snis_client --nolobby --serverhost myipaddr --serverport myport --starship myship --pw myshippw

Replace myipaddr with the IP addr of the server host, myport with the port snis_server is running
on, and myship and myshippw with your ship name and ship password.

Note, you must specify the ip address, not the hostname. (It seems getaddrinfo() doesn't work
with the hostname?  I need to look into why that doesn't work, I think it should.)
