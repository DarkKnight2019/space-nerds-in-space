.SH DESCRIPTION

.warn 511
.PP
ssgl_server is the server process for a very simple game lobby service.
It listens for connections on tcp port 2419 (gamelobby) from game servers
and game clients and provides a mechanism for game clients to connect to
game servers and nothing more.  It requires a gamelobby entry in /etc/services
identifying the "gamelobby" service at tcp and udp port number 2419.
.DI
gamelobby	2419/tcp

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
SSGL_PRIMARY_IP_PROBE_ADDR
.PP
Address used to probe for the host's "primary" IP address. By default,
this is 8.8.8.8.  Note: No packets are transmitted to this address.
.PP
ssgl_server and clients of ssgl_server need to know "the IP address" of the host
they run on so they can communicate this to ssgl_lobby.  This is more complicated
than it might at first seem, because a host may have multiple IP addresses, and
the lobby host might be accessible via localhost, but telling the lobby that the
IP address is 127.0.0.1 is not useful, so we need a way to get the "primary" IP
address.  So we do that by constructing a datagram socket connected to 8.8.8.8,
Google's DNS server (because it is a datagram socket, no packets are transmitted
in forging this "connection"), then using getsockname(2) to figure out the IP address
(network interface) that our host would use to transmit, if we did
transmit (which we don't).  So far so good.
.PP
However, some people want to run on a private network that does not
have any connection to the internet, or have a multi-homed host, and want
to use an internal network interface rather than an external network.
In such a case, connect(2) may fail (e.g. no route to 8.8.8.8),
and ssgl_get_primary_host_ip_addr() returns 0.0.0.0, which is duly registered
with the lobby, but is useless for actually connecting.  Or connect(2) may
succeed, but use the "wrong" interface. So to accomodate
such scenarios, a probe address other than 8.8.8.8 may be specified
for use in determining the primary network interface, e.g. 192.168.1.1
For example:
.DI
.nf

    export SSGL_PRIMARY_IP_PROBE_ADDR=192.168.1.1
