<p>Have you played Endless Sky? I’m playing it these last weeks and it’s really
nice. And it feels like SNIS could take inspiration from it on how to handle
the mission stuff.

<p>Having some real use for the money to buy ships and parts (and also just to
be able to go on as you need to pay salaries to crew) is a good motivation to
do the transport of people/cargo generic missions, and when you go to
spaceports you sometime trigger scripted missions, some of them being part of
complicated story lines.

<p>Doing the same kind of things in SNIS with a crew would feel awesome for
sure. Well I could not pass the same amount of time on SNIS because of how hard
it is to get enough people/computers in the same place to play SNIS, but maybe
something a bit smaller/simpler.  The way factions are handled is quite good
too.

<p>I have not played Endless Sky. I'll at least take a look at some videos though. Thanks for the recommendation.

<p>Here's a quick little demo of a new feature which allows the user to hold
down the SHIFT key and drag UI elements wherever they want to. Not sure it's
terribly useful, but it was easy to implement, so I did.

<p>Once you got VR working, then people can make their own work-spaces like with

(Godot Engine based btw)
